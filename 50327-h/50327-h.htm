 <h2 id='chI'>CHAPTER I.—IN QUEST OF SPARK PLUGS.</h2>

<p class='first'>“That Kentucky shore looks to me like good
hunting.”</p>

<p>“What can you get over there?”</p>

<p>“’Possums, coons, rabbits and squirrels.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll go right now and get a coon.”</p>

<p>Cornelius Witters threw himself back on the
gunwale and laughed and shook until little wavelets
sprang from the sides of the boat and rippled away
over the Ohio river.</p>

<p>“You’ll get lots of coons in the middle of the
afternoon,” he said, finally. “You have to get
coons in the night.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s another night coming, ain’t
there?” suggested Alex Smithwick. “We’re
going to stay here in this eddy until morning, ain’t
we?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to stay till morning,” Jule
Shafer cut in. “The motor has gone wrong, and
Clay doesn’t seem to know how to fix it.”</p>

<p>Clayton Emmett looked up from the motors with
a very smutty face and smiled at the last remark.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, boys,” he said, “this
motor can’t be put in good shape until we get
another consignment of spark plugs.”</p>

<p>The four boys, Clayton Emmett, Alex Smithwick,
Jule Shafer and Cornelius Witters, gathered
about the motor, looking with disgust at its
motionless cranks. The boat had been turned into an
eddy on the Kentucky side of the Ohio river about
noon, and Clay had been working at the machinery
ever since in the hope of getting farther down the
river that night.</p>

<p>“Well,” Case said, after a short silence, “some
one must go out to civilization and buy some spark
plugs. How far do you think we’ll have to go?
Of course these little trading points on the river
don’t keep spark plugs. We’ll be lucky if we even
get gasoline there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“We may be able to buy or borrow spark plugs
from some passing launch or steamer. There are
store-boats on the Ohio, you know, and they may
carry all kinds of motor boat supplies.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” Alex grinned, “there are store-boats
on the Ohio, and whiskey boats, and show-boats,
and house-boats, and about a thousand other kinds
of boats, but I don’t believe they carry such
supplies as we want.”</p>

<p>“It’s just a chance,” Clay went on. “We may
be able to get a supply from some motor boat, but
in the meantime we’d better be looking about in
other directions.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Case exclaimed, excitedly, “Alex
and I will go out hunting and steer toward any
little river town we get wise to. We may find motor
supplies in any old shanty town.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Clay replied. “Go out and get a
mess of squirrels or rabbits while you’re hunting
for a supply store.”</p>

<p>The motor boat <i>Rambler</i> lay in an eddy on the
Kentucky side of the Ohio river, some distance
below Louisville. The four owners had put the boat
into the river at Pittsburg, and were making their
way to the Mississippi at Cairo.</p>

<p>They had only recently returned from an extended
trip up the St. Lawrence river. From Ogdensburg
they had followed the Great Lakes to
Chicago, which was their home. From Ogdensburg
the motor boat had been accompanied by the
launch <i>Cartier</i>, which had been presented to
Captain Joe, one of their old-time friends, because of
important services rendered by the boys. Those
who have read the previous books of this series
will understand the build and speed of the <i>Rambler</i>,
and also the affectionate relations existing between
the four boys and Captain Joe, an ex-sea, lake and
river captain.</p>

<p>Captain Joe had been urged by the lads to
accompany them on their trip down the Ohio with
his launch, but had objected, saying that the boys
would be sure to get into all kinds of scrapes, and
that he did not care to become responsible for the
actions of a crew going about the world looking
for trouble!</p>

<p>The old captain, however, had a very alert and
intelligent representative on board the <i>Rambler</i> in
the person of Captain Joe, a white bulldog of
forbidding appearance. This dog had been purchased
at Para, Brazil, by Alex, and had often made
himself useful during trying situations on previous
trips.</p>

<p>There was also another passenger on board the
<i>Rambler</i> whose name did not appear on the crew
list. This was Teddy, the quarter-grown grizzly
bear which Alex had rescued from a floating tree
in the Columbia river, near the source of that
wonderful stream.</p>

<p>The bear and the dog were very good friends,
playing together like kittens. During their many
river trips the boys had taught the bear to box,
wrestle and frisk about in the water. Captain Joe
was always ready for a tussle with the bear, and
had a habit of following Alex surreptitiously every
time the boy left the boat.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was well supplied with provisions
and ammunition of all kinds, but, the supply of
gasoline running low, the tanks being well-nigh
empty, and the spark plug badly worn, the boys
had proposed early in the day to merely drift down
the river, keeping headway with the sweep.</p>

<p>But a little experience of this mode of traveling
on the great stream had caused them to tie up in
an eddy on the Kentucky side. It was September,
and the Ohio was alive with traffic of all kinds.</p>

<p>During the early part of the day they had passed
several excursion boats, gay with flags and music,
almost a fleet of shanty-boats, and innumerable
packets, stern-wheelers and side-wheelers.
Drifting with no control to speak of, the
<i>Rambler</i> had several times come very near
collision with larger boats.</p>

<p>On the Ohio, as well as on the Mississippi and
the St. Lawrence, the traffic-men seem to have a
great contempt for those who go about in gasoline
boats. Captains and pilots unite in making trouble
for the owners of such craft whenever it is
possible to do so.</p>

<p>Once that forenoon the <i>Rambler</i> had come very
near destruction because of a monstrous tow of
coal barges moving down upon it. Later, the boys
had been annoyed and insulted by a gang of toughs
who were lounging over the railing of a whiskey boat
which was passing up the river.</p>

<p>It was finally arranged that Alex and Case should
go ashore and look about for a place where supplies
might be purchased. There were no settlements in
sight from the point where the <i>Rambler</i> lay, but
the boys thought that, as she lay just above a great
bend which swept around a long peninsula,
turning to the south at last, there might be business
places not far away which were not in view.</p>

<p>“And while you are gone,” Jule called out as
the boys rowed ashore, “catch a coon and half a
dozen squirrels. I can make a squirrel pie that will
bring Captain Joe down from Chicago!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Alex called back. “We’ll bring
game enough to last a week. Get your fires all
ready by dark.”</p>

<p>The shore on which the boys found themselves
a few moments later was wild and rocky. There
were great oaks towering along the side hills and
immense trees of hickory, beech and walnut shut
out the view on all sides. There was also a heavy
undergrowth.</p>

<p>“Where are you heading for?” asked Case, as
Alex turned into a thicket and went tramping
through it with a great noise.</p>

<p>“I think,” Alex replied, “that we’d better keep
off to the west and south. I looked at a map of
the river just before I left the boat, and there’s a
great bend here. We can walk across it in an hour
or two, but it would take half a day to float or row
around it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Case answered. “There may be a town
in a nook around the bend. That’s where they
build towns in this country.”</p>

<p>The boys made good time for an hour or more,
when they came out on the bank of the river perhaps
three miles from the boat, across the bend,
and ten or fifteen by way of the river. Just below
them, hardly forty rods from the point where they
emerged from the underbrush, they saw a little
river settlement composed of half a dozen ramshackle
houses, a fishing dock, and one store
building.</p>

<p>“There!” Alex said. “I’ll bet we find spark
plugs there!”</p>

<p>“If we find as many spark plugs there as we
didn’t find squirrels coming through,” Case laughed,
“It will take a long time to get our motor started.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Alex answered, “we didn’t look
very hard for squirrels, anyway. We’ll see what
they’ve got here, and do our hunting on the way
back.”</p>

<p>“Clay may get what we want from some of the
boats,” Case suggested. “There are lots of boats
on the river that ought to carry spark plugs. It’s
dollars to apples that every motor boat we’ve seen
to-day carries an extra supply.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do us any good,” Alex answered,
“if they don’t show a disposition to pass them
around.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” Case went on, “I’m afraid of
some of those river boats. There’s a tougher gang
on some of them than you’ll find on Clark street.
They drink third-rail whiskey, made up in the
mountains, and are ready to do murder after a
dozen doses of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex said, “we’ll just have to watch
out, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You remember that red, white and blue boat
we saw yesterday?” Case went on. “That was a
gambling house proper. Just looking over the
gunwale into the cabin windows, I saw roulette wheels
in operation and three faro layouts crowded with
excited gamblers.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Alex assented, “and it looked to me
like they were playing stud poker out in the open.
It’s a wonder the people along the river don’t put
dynamite under those boats some night.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Case suggested, “that the people
along the river are more afraid of the store-boats
than they are of the gambling boats. These
store-boat men steal everything they can get their hands
on. They have been known to raid small towns,
strip the shelves of the business places, and even
take valuable furniture and musical instruments
from the residences. When they get a boat load
of this sort of plunder, they take it down to New
Orleans, where it is disposed of by men who make
a business of doing that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Alex scratched his red head and wrinkled his
freckled nose for a minute and then turned to his
chum with a grin on his face.</p>

<p>“If they try to get the <i>Rambler</i>,” he said, “don’t
forget that we have dynamite under the after deck
near the gasoline tanks.”</p>

<p>“If they try to get the <i>Rambler</i>,” Case exclaimed,
“they’ll do it while we are away on shore, or asleep.
These river rats are too cowardly to put up an
open fight. They do their work in the dark.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason why I don’t like being away
from the boat long at a time,” Alex went on.
“Clay and Jule would do anything any two boys
could do to protect our property, but, all the same,
two boys wouldn’t cut much ice with a gang of
river pirates like I’ve seen on those boats.”</p>

<p>As the boy ceased speaking he laid an excited
hand on Case’s shoulder and turned his face in the
direction from which they had come.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he asked.</p>

<p>Case nodded and turned back to the east.</p>

<p>“It sounded like a gun,” he exclaimed. “I’m
going back to the boat.”</p>

<p>Alex held him back and pointed toward the
settlement below.</p>

<p>“We may as well see about the spark plugs,” he
advised. “It won’t take us very much longer.
That noise may be only hunters, anyway.”</p>

<p>Trying their best to conceal their excitement, the
boys moved down the slope to the river bank and
stopped on a level platform before the store door.
The shots were now coming in a volley.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chII'>CHAPTER II.—A “FRIENDLY” CAPTAIN.</h2>

<p class='first'>After the departure of Alex and Case, Clay
and Jule continued their efforts to get the motor
into working order. In the meantime, however,
they kept a sharp lookout for the approach of some
boat which might possibly supply them with what
they needed.</p>

<p>However, they had little hope of relief from any
river craft.</p>

<p>“There must be some towns along the river,
below the bend,” Jule insisted. “The boys will find
some sort of place where motor supplies are sold.”</p>

<p>“If they do,” Clay answered, “I hope they’ll
bring a whole pocketful of spark plugs.”</p>

<p>“And I hope they’ll bring back a dozen squirrels,
and six rabbits, and a coon, and a ’possum!” Jule
laughed. “Here we’ve been on this river all the
way down from Pittsburg, and haven’t had any
wild game yet! I’ve eaten fish until I believe there
are fins growing on my toes.”</p>

<p>“There’s a large motor boat coming down,”
Clay said, pointing up stream. “Perhaps we can
get what we want by going aboard.”</p>

<p>“Looks like a pretty decent sort of a craft,”
Jule suggested.</p>

<p>“It looks to me like a store-boat, anyhow,” Clay
went on.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll give ’em a hail!”</p>

<p>The call from the <i>Rambler</i> was answered
immediately, and a large-sized motor boat turned in
toward the Kentucky shore. The name “Hawk”
was discernible on the prow as she came slowly on.</p>

<p>“What idiot named a sailing vessel after a
bird?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“She may be a bird, at that,” decided Clay.
“She looks as if she could go some, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Hello, the boat!” now came from the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>“Have you got motor supplies?” Clay called
back.</p>

<p>“What kind of supplies?”</p>

<p>“Spark plugs,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Come on board and we’ll fit you out.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” Jule shouted.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound for?” called out a man
on the deck of the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>“Just down the river,” Clay answered.</p>

<p>The man who had been speaking from the freight
deck of the <i>Hawk</i> now turned away and conversed
for a moment with two men who had been listening
to the conversation. As the fellow talked, he
pointed with his thumb over his shoulder,
significantly, at the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of this!” Clay declared.</p>

<p>“Then let’s cut it out,” replied Jule.</p>

<p>“We can’t very well cut it out!” Clay exclaimed.
“They probably know we’re tied up here with a
disabled motor. If they are the kind of people
we fear they are, they’ll come and get us anyway.
I wish Alex and Case were here.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stay here and shoot if they attempt to
board us?” asked Jule, the light of battle flaming
in his usually merry eyes.</p>

<p>Clay thought hard for a moment and then turned
back to the cabin for his automatic, which he took
good care to keep out of sight.</p>

<p>“Are you coming aboard?” the man shouted
from the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>“We haven’t any boat,” Clay replied. “Our
friends have gone hunting on shore.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fix that all right,” was called back, and
in a moment a rowboat rounded the stern of the
<i>Hawk</i> and made its way rapidly to the <i>Rambler</i>.
The boys watched the appearance of the boat with
premonitions of danger. The two rowers looked
like veritable river pirates.</p>

<p>“Pile in!” shouted one of the men gruffly as he
held on to the anchor-chain of the motor boat.
“Hustle yourselves in here, and I’ll have you over
to the <i>Hawk</i> in a minute.”</p>

<p>Motioning to Jule to remain where he was, Clay
dropped into the rowboat and told the man to pull
away.</p>

<p>“Isn’t your friend coming?” one of the rowers
asked.</p>

<p>“We can’t leave the boat alone,” was the reply.
“Why, we’ll be right here alongside,” urged the
other.</p>

<p>As he spoke he lifted a hairy, repulsive face
toward the <i>Rambler</i> and shouted:</p>

<p>“Come on, lad, the captain is fixing up a treat
for you boys!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to stay on board,” Jule answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, come along,” ordered the other, almost
angrily.</p>

<p>“Pull away,” Clay advised, “we never leave the
boat alone, night or day. It isn’t safe to do so on
the Ohio.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that isn’t a bad notion, either,” one of
the rowers replied, with a sullen smile. “Perhaps
the captain will send some one on board to keep him
company.”</p>

<p>Clay saw by the significant and sneering looks
passing between the two men that they considered
him a prisoner already. So much of a prisoner,
in fact, that they did not consider it necessary to
attempt to conceal their contempt and their triumph.</p>

<p>Had the <i>Rambler</i> been in fit condition he would
have leaped out of the boat and speeded away. It
seemed to him now, however, that the common-sense
course would be to find out exactly what kind
of a boat the <i>Hawk</i> was before taking any steps
having the appearance of alarm.</p>

<p>“All right!” the boy answered in response to
the rower’s offer to send some one on board to keep
Jule company, “the boy may become lonesome
after a time, although I shall be gone only a very
few moments.”</p>

<p>“There’s a mighty jolly crowd on board our
boat,” the rower went on. “There’s many a man
gets aboard for an hour’s ride and never gets off
for a hundred miles.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it!” Clay said with a laugh.</p>

<p>It was the work of only a moment to land the
unwilling boy on the freight deck of the <i>Hawk</i>.
He was at once surrounded by a group of men who
seemed to represent all grades of society. There
was the well-dressed man wearing diamonds and
the man who was garbed like a river rat!</p>

<p>The captain was a hatchet-faced man with rat
eyes and a perfect bill of a nose. His manner was
offensive as he approached Clay familiarly and laid
a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“So you’re going down the river on a little trip
of your own, eh?” he asked. “Nice boat you’ve
got.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clay answered, “it’s not expensive, but
it’s pretty well rigged out. She’s a bit fast, too,
when in good shape.”</p>

<p>“Looks like she could go some,” agreed the
captain.</p>

<p>“What are you trading in?” asked a
handsomely-dressed man who looked enough like the
captain to be his brother.</p>

<p>“Oh,” Clay replied, “we’re just out for amusement;
taking our vacation on the river.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good bluff, too,” the other sneered.
“People don’t trail along the Ohio just for the fun
of the thing.”</p>

<p>“If you’ve got whiskey aboard,” another called
out, “you want to keep off our beat. We’re doing
a little in that line ourselves.”</p>

<p>By this time Clay was thoroughly frightened.
He saw that he was in the hands of a desperate and
reckless gang of river thieves. While pretending
to be a store-boat, the <i>Hawk</i> was merely a floating
receptacle for stolen goods, with gambling as an
assistant money-maker.</p>

<p>“You said,” the boy began in a moment, trying
his best to conceal what he really felt, “that you
could fit me out with spark plugs if I came on
board.”</p>

<p>“Sure, we can!” answered the captain, with a
sty wink at another. We can fit you out with
anything on this little old boat.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Clay answered, “if you’ll get me
the plugs, I’ll pay for them and go back to the
<i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“No hurry!” laughed the captain. “No hurry
at all. Still,” he continued, “if you’re anxious to
get back, I’ll send one of the boys into the
storeroom to look for the spark plug while you come
up for a little social visit in the cabin.”</p>

<p>“No need of that,” smiled Clay, “I may as well
remain on the lower deck. It probably won’t take
long to find what I need.</p>

<p>The captain took the boy by the arm in a manner
evidently intended to be friendly.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” he said. “We’ve got a slick
little boat here, and I want you to look her over.”</p>

<p>“You bet we have!” cried another, “and we
don’t let guests leave us without giving them
something of a treat.”</p>

<p>Clay’s inclination was to deal the insulting
captain a blow in the face, plunge into the river, and
make for the <i>Rambler</i>. He knew very well,
however, that such a course would instantly bring about
hostilities; whereas, if he pretended to be unaware
of their purpose, assistance in some form might
come to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, come along!” urged the captain. “I’ll
send a couple of boys over to bring your chum,
and we’ll have a jolly night of it.”</p>

<p>It was useless for Clay to falter or draw back,
so he stepped along as if grateful for the invitation.
His hope was that Jule would understand the
situation of affairs on board the <i>Hawk</i> and stand guard
on deck with a good supply of automatic revolvers.</p>

<p>“Where’d you say you came from?” asked the
captain as they ascended the stairway to the cabin.
“Chicago,” was the short reply.</p>

<p>“Nice town, Chicago,” the captain went on with
a leer. “I used to live in Chicago. I know every
foot of the North Branch. Goose Island used to be
my favorite resort.”</p>

<p>Clay was thinking that if the captain had ever
resided in Chicago he must have left it at the
request of the police, but did not say so. Reaching
the cabin, the captain led Clay to a long, narrow
stateroom looking out on the Kentucky shore. He
took pains, however, to seat the boy so that he could
not look out on the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>Before seating himself the captain proceeded to
a cupboard hanging on the wall and took out two
bottles and a siphon. One of the bottles contained
whiskey; the other wine.</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” the captain said, “that this
moonshine whiskey is a little bit too strong for boys,
so I’ll give you a glass of wine. That’s prime wine,
too. I bought it in Pittsburg and paid a big price
for it. If you were to buy that wine, kiddo, you’d
pay about two bits a glass for it. It’s the right
kind of stuff.”</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t buy it!” Clay answered with
a smile. “The fact is,” he continued, “we haven’t
got any money to waste on drink, and don’t care
for it, anyway.”</p>

<p>The captain went to a faucet with a glass and
brought back two goblets of water. Just before
he turned away from the faucet Clay was certain
that he saw him dropping something into one of
the glasses.</p>

<p>“Well,” the captain said, sitting down at the
table and pushing one of the glasses over toward
Clay, “I don’t urge any boy to drink anything
intoxicating, but it would take a lot of this wine to
creep up to a man’s head. Perhaps a glass of water
will be just as good for you.”</p>

<p>Clay suspected that if he drank the water he
would soon become unconscious. The captain of
the <i>Hawk</i> was playing a quick game. He had not
been aboard the vessel more than five minutes, and
yet here he was in the captain’s cabin, being urged
to partake of a drugged drink!</p>

<p>He arose with the glass in his hand, walked to
the open window and looked out. The glass
dropped with a crash. The act was involuntary
for Clay saw the <i>Rambler</i> whirling away down the
stream.</p>

 <h2 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III.—RESISTING AN OFFICER.</h2>

<p class='first'>While Alex and Case stood, hesitating, on the
little platform in front of the store, two men came
rushing out with excitement showing in their faces.</p>

<p>“What’s the shooting, boys?” one of them asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea,” Alex replied. “We just
came from that part of the country, and everything
was quiet when we left.”</p>

<p>“It’s a sure thing,” one of the men, who seemed
to be owner of the store, declared angrily, “that
those river pirates have broken loose again.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” his companion answered.</p>

<p>“Do they give you much trouble?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“Trouble!” exclaimed the merchant. “They
come here and strip my shelves. They bring a
howling mob of river rats into the town and take
everything they can get their hands on.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you have them arrested?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Arrested!” exclaimed the other. “They’re
here one night and the next night they’re hundreds
of miles away, with a new coat of paint and a new
name on their boat. Besides all that, you can’t get
half the officers along here to take any action at
all. You go to them and make a complaint and
they’ll say that the robbery wasn’t committed in
their county, or in their township, or in the state
of Kentucky, or something of that kind! My
honest opinion is that they’re afraid of the pirates.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put it too strong,” the other advised.
“There’s some pretty good officers along the river.
Besides, there’s the Government boats.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s the Government boats,” decided
the merchant, “but the Government boats are as
easy to keep track of as a white elephant would be
in our main street. The river rats wait until Uncle
Sam’s boats get out of sight before they attempt
any mischief.”</p>

<p>During this conversation, the boys had been
listening for more pistol shots from the direction in
which the <i>Rambler</i> lay. They had little doubt that
Clay and Jule were in trouble. They knew, too,
that the <i>Rambler</i> was virtually helpless, so the boys
had no chance whatever of escaping from any
hostile boat. Directly Alex turned to the merchant
and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you keep motor boat supplies?”</p>

<p>The merchant turned to his friend and indulged
in a long, slow, insulting wink.</p>

<p>“So,” he said significantly, “you boys have a
motor boat up the river?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case replied, “but the motors are out of
order.”</p>

<p>“Is that where the shootin’ is?” asked the merchant.</p>

<p>“There was no shooting when we left,” Alex answered.</p>

<p>“Come, come, now!” the merchant advised.
“You boys may as well tell me the truth. Was it
one of them pirate boats that sent you here after
motor supplies?”</p>

<p>“We have a motor boat of our own,” Alex answered
angrily. “She is lying in an eddy on the
other side of the bend, and we don’t dare to drift
her down stream.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” said the suspicious merchant
with another long and insulting wink. “What is
it you want in the way of supplies?”</p>

<p>“Spark plugs,” was the short answer.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the merchant, “extending a bony
finger and poking Alex on the chest, “I keep a few
spark plugs because there are a good many motor
boats passing along the river.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed the man who stood with him
on the platform, “you keep spark plugs, but you
take pretty good care not to sell them to men who
will put them to unlawful use.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” said the merchant.</p>

<p>“Will you sell us some?” asked Case indignantly.</p>

<p>“I might,” was the reply, “after a time. Just
now, you see,” he went on, regarding his companion
knowingly, “just now, we think we’d better hold
you boys until we find out what all that shooting is
about.”</p>

<p>“Hold us?” repeated Alex and Case in a breath.</p>

<p>“It’s just this way,” the merchant went on,
“this man here is constable in this township. It
was him I was giving the dig to a little while ago
about the officers not being ready to take action.”</p>

<p>The officer turned back the lapel of his coat and
ostentatiously displayed a brass badge.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I’m constable of this township,
and old Bill, here, never gets tired of telling folks
that the officers ain’t no account.”</p>

<p>The two men roared lustily, pounding each other
on the shoulders, evidently regarding the whole
affair as a good joke.</p>

<p>“Come,” Alex said, “will you sell me some
spark plugs?”</p>

<p>“You can’t buy nothin’ just now,” the constable
declared. “You’re both under arrest!”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“We think,” the constable replied, “that the
pirates sent you here to look over the town and see
what they could get. That’s too thin, your talking
about spark plugs. Why, every boat carries a lot
of them.”</p>

<p>“If this man is a constable,” urged Alex, “why
don’t he hasten over to the other side of the bend
and find out what that shooting is about?”</p>

<p>“There,” snarled the constable, “now I know
you’re in cahoots with a gang of river thieves. Old
Bill, here, heard you try to get me to go right up
there where they’re shooting, tried to get me to run
my neck right into a noose!”</p>

<p>“They’re dangerous boys,” the merchant
suggested. “Why don’t you look them over for
weapons?”</p>

<p>By this time quite a crowd was collecting about
the little store. The merchant and the constable
were receiving all sorts of advice, and women and
girls stood about with red hands rolled up in their
aprons, watching the two suspects with frightened
eyes.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’d better be seeing what they’ve got
on,” the constable said with an important air.
“They probably didn’t come down here without
guns.”</p>

<p>As the constable stepped forward Alex and Case
exchanged quick glances, each asking the other
what ought to be done. They understood that
arrest there meant confinement in a country jail for
several days, perhaps weeks, before they could
establish their identity.</p>

<p>They knew, too, that their assistance was needed
on board the <i>Rambler</i>. The shooting had disclosed
a situation anything but peaceful.</p>

<p>“Come on, now, boys!” the constable shouted
“Let’s see what you’ve got in your pockets.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you try to hide nothing away from
us, either,” the merchant added. “Turn your
pockets wrong side out.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex said, so angry that his face
was whiter than Case had ever seen him before.
“We’ll show you what we’ve got in our pockets.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew forth an automatic revolver
and held it threateningly at the head of the
constable. Case was not slow in following his
example. The little crowd instantly scattered; some
dashing around the corners of the store and others
hiding behind barrels and boxes. The women
present let out such screams as the boys had never heard
before. The merchant and the constable both
broke for the store door. Such a scattering the
little town had never seen before that day.</p>

<p>In a second the constable opened the door of the
store about six inches and peered out, shaking a
rusty shotgun in one hand. The merchant stood
behind him, looking out of the glass panel and
showing an old army carbine.</p>

<p>“We’re armed! We’re armed!” called out the
constable. “Don’t you try to come in here! You
boys will get a life sentence for this!”</p>

<p>“This is highway robbery, and murder, and
piracy!” shouted the merchant.</p>

<p>The boys backed away from the platform so as
to be out of reach of any shot from the angle of the
building and paused a second for consultation.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him buffaloed!” was Alex’s, first
remark.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better be getting out?” Case asked.
“I’ve a good mind to go in there and fill my
pockets with spark plugs,” Alex declared.</p>

<p>“That would be a nice thing to do, wouldn’t it?”
scoffed Case. “That would be larceny from a store
in the daytime, and you can get fifteen years for
that; and if you went into a store with a gun and
put the keeper in peril of his life, you could get
fifty or sixty years!”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t do it!” grinned Alex.</p>

<p>“It’s me for the <i>Rambler</i>!” Case declared. “It
will take us until dark to get there now, and as soon
as we turn our backs that bum constable will have
a hundred men out after us.”</p>

<p>“And that means that we’ve got to hot-foot
through the bushes!” Alex declared. “We can
beat ’em if they don’t get dogs.”</p>

<p>The boys turned into the undergrowth and ran,
tearing their clothes and scratching their hands on
wild vines, and occasionally falling over a protruding
tree-root. At one time they both lay in a heap
at the foot of a beech tree, where they had fallen
over a mass of vines. When they scrambled to
their feet they heard shouts of laughter coming
from a thicket not far away.</p>

<p>“Guess they’ve got us!” panted Alex.</p>

<p>“I guess they have!” Case agreed.</p>

<p>The next moment the brown barrel of a rifle was
thrust out at the boys. The boys sat flat down on
the ground and waited.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” the holder of the gun said,
stepping out of the thicket. “Set right down and
take things easy. If you try to unlimber any
artillery, you’ll get the worst of it.”</p>

<p>The man was tall, bony, angular. His face was
clean-shaven, showing high cheek bones, with
prominent nose and a cleft chin. His hair was brown, his
eyes blue, and the general expression of his face at
that moment was humorous rather than threatening.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” Alex asked.</p>

<p>“You don’t look like a man capable of holding
up two boys!” Case put in. “You look like a
pretty decent chap.”</p>

<p>“If you’ve got any masked batteries with you,”
the man said a smile showing on his rugged face,
“just poke them out here, handle first, and then
we’ll arrive at some understanding!”</p>

<p>The boys did as directed, although they would
have made a fight for their weapons only for the
indescribable air of friendliness about the man.
They rose to their feet as they dropped their
revolvers.</p>

<p>“Better put that gun down,” Alex advised.
“You might get excited and let it go off.”</p>

<p>The man sat down on a fallen log and laid the
gun across his knees.</p>

<p>“Where you boys from?” he asked.</p>

<p>The man’s voice and manner invited confidence,
and the boys told him briefly the story of the
<i>Rambler</i>, and of the shooting at the point where
they had left her.</p>

<p>“I think you boys are all right,” the man said,
and I think, too, that river pirates are making
trouble for your friends.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they will follow us from the
landing?” Case asked, anxiously. “They may shoot
us from the bushes.”</p>

<p>The man pounded his thigh with one ponderous
hand and laughed until the woods rang. The boys
looked on in wonder.</p>

<p>“Follow you? I should say not,” he said in a
moment. “Why that constable deputized me to
come and take you prisoners. He’s helping old
Bill barricade his store. Now we’ll see if we can
find out what’s wrong with the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV.—A DIVE FOR LIBERTY.</h2>

<p class='first'>Left alone on board the <i>Rambler</i>, Jule lay for
a long time behind the gunwale watching the <i>Hawk</i>.
He saw Clay surrounded by a group of ill-looking
fellows as soon as he gained the freight deck. He
knew by the boy’s face that all was not going well.</p>

<p>When Clay was taken up the cabin stairs and
into the stateroom by the captain, Jule got out his
field glass and scrutinized the windows of the boat.
Directly he saw the captain come to a window
facing the <i>Rambler</i> and look out. Clay was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>Lying thus, almost flat on the deck, watching the
<i>Hawk</i> intently, the boy could not see what was
going on on the starboard side of the boat. Indeed,
so closely was he watching the <i>Hawk</i> that he did
not notice a little shiver which ran through the
craft as two husky men crept over the gunwale and
stood looking down upon him.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid!” one of the men said roughly in a
moment.</p>

<p>Jule turned around to see two revolvers pointing
at his head. He laid down his automatic and rose
to his feet. The two men on the deck before him
were signaling to the men on the <i>Hawk</i>, while the
latter were shouting words of congratulation.</p>

<p>“Oh, Gid and I got her all right!” one of the
men said.</p>

<p>“You bet we did,” the man referred to as Gid
went on.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with the boy?” was the next
question.</p>

<p>“We’ll send after him,” was the reply from the
<i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>Jule walked over to a chair and sat down.
There was nothing whatever he could do. He knew
that Clay was in the hands of the river pirates, and
that resistance would be useless.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” he said finally, “I’d rather
stay on board the <i>Rambler</i>. It seems like home
here.”</p>

<p>“There’s more fun on board the <i>Hawk</i>,” laughed
Gid.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there’s anything to drink on
board this boat?” asked Gid’s companion.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of water,” answered Jule.</p>

<p>“Don’t insult Mike with a drink of water,” Gid
advised; “Mike likes water to that extent that he
won’t even wash in it.”</p>

<p>“He looks it!” Jule declared.</p>

<p>“No lip, now, young fellow!” Mike broke in.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the boat?”
asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Why, this boat,” Gid answered, “will make a
fine tender for the <i>Hawk</i>. We’ve been wanting a
fine boat like this for a long time. You see, we get
parties on board the <i>Hawk</i>, sometimes, who need
a little more care than the ordinary river chap.
When such get tired of our company, and we’re
willing to let them go, we take ’em home in style.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Jule answered, “the motors are out of
order, so you can’t run the <i>Rambler</i>, and I’m not
sorry for that, either.”</p>

<p>“We can tow her, can’t we, until we can get the
motors fixed?” asked Mike. “It won’t take much
to fix the engine.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Jule said. “When you get her
fixed up all right we’ll take her off your hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will, will you?” laughed Gid. “If you
don’t watch out, son, you’ll be wanting some one to
take you off our hands.”</p>

<p>The two men now moved up to the prow of the
boat and whispered together for a long time. They
paid no attention to signals and calls from the
<i>Hawk</i>, and so a small boat was soon making its
way toward the <i>Rambler</i>. Jule saw the two men
handling their guns nervously as the boat supposed
to contain members of their own party approached.</p>

<p>The boy watched the situation anxiously. It
seemed to him that the two men who had
boarded the <i>Rambler</i> were not at all pleased at the
approach of the rowboat. It appeared, too, that
those on board the <i>Hawk</i> were watching Gid and
Mike suspiciously.</p>

<p>When the boat drew near, the man who had been
called Mike leaned over the gunwale with a
revolver in each hand.</p>

<p>“Keep away, boys!” he said. “We don’t want
you on board!”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” demanded the mate of
the <i>Hawk</i>, who was one of the men in the small
boat.</p>

<p>“Never mind what it means,” Mike called out.</p>

<p>“Keep away from the boat if you don’t want to be
shot!”</p>

<p>While Mike was holding the mate off with his
revolvers, Gid stood by the boy also with revolvers
in sight. The mate of the <i>Hawk</i> threw his hand
back as if to produce a weapon and Mike passed a
bullet so close to the side of his head that it scorched
his scalp.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to get out any guns!” the man
ordered. “Get back to the <i>Hawk</i> and stay there!”</p>

<p>“What right have you to take that boat?”
demanded the mate.</p>

<p>“No words, now!” Mike shouted. “Get back
to the <i>Hawk</i>!”</p>

<p>“We’ll sink you if you move away from here!”
shouted the mate.</p>

<p>“You’ll do lot’s of sinking, with Government
boats patrolling the river!” mocked Mike. “You’d
get pinched in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“How do you expect to get away with that
boat?” demanded the mate.</p>

<p>“Why, we’ve got one of the owners on board,”
Mike laughed back, “and he’ll tell the Government
officers anything we ask him to.”</p>

<p>“And look here, Mr. River Thief!” Gid joined
in, “if you make any noise about the taking of this
boat, or try to make trouble for us, or open your
mouths to the river police, we’ll give the <i>Hawk</i>
away good and plenty. Every murder and every
dirty game that’s been played on board will be in
the Government’s books within twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>Slowly, sullenly, the mate turned the boat around
and headed for the <i>Hawk</i>, glancing back over his
shoulders with angry eyes as he did so. Hoots of
derision came to him from the deck of the <i>Hawk</i>
as he returned. It was quite evident that those on
board the <i>Hawk</i> knew what had taken place.</p>

<p>“Look here, kid!” Gid said to Jule as the boat
turned back, “get down there and loosen the anchor-chain.
We must be getting out of this and we haven’t got
time to hoist her up!”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it while there’s a strain on the chain,”
Jule answered.</p>

<p>“Then wait a minute,” directed the other, “and
she’ll probably slacken up.”</p>

<p>Caught in a contrary swirl of the eddy in which
she lay, the <i>Rambler</i> gave a lurch ahead, in a
moment, and Jule took the opportunity of slipping the
stopper from the chain.</p>

<p>When the boat settled back again the chain ran
out of the hawse-pipe with a clatter which
attracted the attention of those on board the <i>Hawk</i>,
and many oaths and epithets were passed back and
forth over the water.</p>

<p>Not for long, however, for the <i>Rambler</i>
swinging out into the current, gradually swept down.
Now she ran stern against the current, now prow
against the current; now sideways; now swirling
round and round in an ugly whirlpool.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Clay, approaching
the window in the captain’s stateroom, saw what
had taken place. He turned to the latter a face
red with anger, his eyes flashing, his fists clenched.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of that?” he asked
pointing out of the window.</p>

<p>The captain bounded to the window and peered
out. At that moment an imperative knock sounded
on the stateroom door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded the captain, opening
the door and starting out. “Why is that boat
running away?”</p>

<p>“Mike and Gid have stolen her!” shouted the
mate. “They threatened me with guns when I
tried to board her. Now they threaten all on board
the <i>Hawk</i> if we attempt to recapture
the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>The captain tore about the stateroom in a blind
rage, dancing up and down and shaking his fists in
every direction. The mate stood by only a trifle
less excited. It looked like a show to Clay.</p>

<p>“I’ll kill the dirty dogs!” shouted the captain.
“I’ll murder them both before they’re a week
older! They threatened me, did they? They
threatened to turn us over to the officers,
did they?”</p>

<p>“That’s what they did!” shouted the mate.
“Mike had the drop on me, or I would have
settled the matter right then.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on Clay stood
by the stateroom window, wondering whether it
would be possible for him to leap out and drop to
the river. His idea was that the men who had
stolen the <i>Rambler</i> could not by any possibility be
more vicious than the men on board the <i>Hawk</i>;
besides, if he could reach Jule, the two might stand
some chance of recovering the motor boat.</p>

<p>While he stood making up his mind to undertake
the difficult task of leaving the boat without being
detected by those on the outside, two pistol shots
came from the deck. Instantly the captain and
mate whirled out of the stateroom, the latter
stopping for an instant to lock the door before dashing
down to the scene of the disturbance.</p>

<p>Clay knew by the trembling of the deck under
his feet that they were getting the <i>Hawk</i> under
way. He saw little puffs of smoke coming from
the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>, and rightly surmised that
the shots had been fired at her. While he stood
undecided, the <i>Hawk</i> began moving down stream,
following in the wake of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>Without waiting another instant, the boy made
his way out of the window and clung to the casing
until his feet came in contact with one of the
fenders. Then he dropped down into the river with
a splash which, in the excitement of getting away,
was not observed by those on the lower deck.
Indeed, the boy was some distance from the pirate
vessel before his absence was discovered at all.
Then the captain returned to his stateroom and
found it empty.</p>

<p>Rushing to the window, he fired several shots at
the boy, but all to no purpose. He was greatly
excited, and the boy was diving and dodging in the
water so not one of the bullets took effect.</p>

<p>When Mike and Gid, on board the <i>Rambler</i>, saw
the boy swimming in the water they naturally
supposed him to be one of the crew of the <i>Hawk</i>.
Therefore, they began firing at him, thus placing
him between two dangers.</p>

<p>Seeing that it would be impossible for him to
board the <i>Rambler</i> under the circumstances, the
boy dropped down in the water and made for the
shore, where he landed, sorely out of breath, in a
few moments.</p>

<p>It was September, so the water was not very
cold, and Clay suffered little inconvenience from his
bath at that time. His first act was to secrete
himself behind the bole of a large hickory tree and
watch what was going on in the river.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was still drifting down with the
current, wheeling this way and that, threatened
with destruction nearly every instant. The <i>Hawk</i>,
now under full power, was shooting past her,
evidently with the intention of heading her off and
blocking farther progress.</p>

<p>While the boy looked and waited he saw a white
head lifted above the gunwale and the next
moment Captain Joe, the bulldog, leaped into the
river. Clay gave a low whistle to direct the dog
in his direction and stood with his heart in his
mouth, almost, waiting to see if the brutes on board
the motor boat would fire at the bulldog.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, however, Gid and Mike
were busy with sweeps and oars trying to get the
<i>Rambler</i> out of an eddy around which it was
whirling aimlessly. Jule looked over the gunwale of the
boat in a moment and Clay signaled to him from
behind the tree. The next moment the bulldog
sprang upon Clay in joyful greeting and the two
disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>Jule went back into the cabin and threw himself
down on a bunk.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” he moaned, “that we’ll ever
get the <i>Rambler</i> away from these thieves!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chV'>CHAPTER V.—CAPTAIN JOE ON SHORE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“I’ll tell you right now,” Alex declared, panting
and out of breath in his efforts to keep pace with
the long stride of the new-found friend, “that there
isn’t anything the matter with the <i>Rambler</i>. There
never was anything wrong with the boat, and there
never will be. She may be in trouble, but she’s
been there before.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case added, “and we’ve always gotten
her out of her troubles, and we’ll do it again.
What’s your name, Mister?” he added, turning to
the lanky guide who was forcing them through the
thickets at such swift pace.</p>

<p>“My name,” the other replied, “is Hank Beers.
I live up in the mountains, and I came down to-day
to see about negotiating for a little product I make
up there.”</p>

<p>“Are you a moonshiner?” asked Case, innocently.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not a moonshiner,” replied Hank.
“I’m making a superior quality of aeroplanes up
in the hills. When I get one finished I put it in a
suit case and bring it down.”</p>

<p>“That means,” Alex laughed, “that the product
of your factory is intended to send people up in the
air!”</p>

<p>“Put it any way you like,” laughed Hank. “The
point with us now is to find out what’s become of
that boat of yours. You say you left her up at the
stem of the bend?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Case, “we left her to get a
spark plug and some squirrels. That shooting, you
know, may not have been at the <i>Rambler</i> or from
the <i>Rambler</i>. We may be unnecessarily excited
about it.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” declared Hank, “when you hear
shooting going on like that in this vicinity, you just
make up your mind that the river pirates have
something to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they get out and lynch these river
pirates?” demanded Case.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive!” exclaimed Hank. “If we Kentuckians
lynched all the people who make us trouble,
we’d have to import telegraph poles to hang ’em
on. There wouldn’t be anywhere near enough trees
for the business.”</p>

<p>“I thought Kentucky was a law-abiding state,”
remarked Alex.</p>

<p>“She’s the most law-abiding state you ever heard
tell of,” replied Hank with a laugh. “All the
trouble is,” he went on, “that sometimes we
mountain people make laws of our own, and when we do
that the laws have to be abided by.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Case grinned, “I remember the
Knights of the Golden Circle, and the Ku Klux
Klan, and the Night-Riders, and the White Caps.
When that bunch wanted to kill a man, all they
did was to pass a law against him and then abide
by it.”</p>

<p>“There are a whole lot of offenses,” the
mountaineer went on, “that can’t be handled by the laws
these here shysters put on the statute books. But,”
he continued, “we won’t talk about that any more.
We wouldn’t agree, anyhow. About how far are
we from the point where you left your boat?”</p>

<p>“Two miles,” declared Alex.</p>

<p>“Three!” suggested Case.</p>

<p>“What time did you leave the boat?” asked
Hank.</p>

<p>“Two o’clock,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Hank looked at a ponderous silver watch which
he took from a back pocket of his trousers and
shook his head.</p>

<p>“If you left the boat at two o’clock,” he said,
“and you had just come to the settlement when
that little ruction started, you were something like
three hours on the way. That means more than
three miles.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” Alex agreed, “but we wandered
about this way and that, looking for squirrels, and
coons, and rabbits, so I think that we ought to be
somewhere near the boat by this time.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t come to it pretty soon,” the
mountaineer suggested, “we’ll have to look for it
in the dark. It is getting twilight in here right
now. It will soon be almost impossible to make our
way through the thickets. ’Tarnal bad woods in
the night time, these are.”</p>

<p>Darkness was indeed settling over the forest.
To make matters worse, a mass of heavy clouds
was drifting up from the Mississippi valley,
and the chances were remarkably good for a long,
slow rain. After proceeding some farther in the
thicket, Alex took out his electric
searchlight—without which he never left
the <i>Rambler</i>—and threw its rays on the
thicket ahead. As he did so Hank seized him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Douse it, douse it!” the mountaineer cried.
“Don’t you know any better than to make a light
in here?”</p>

<p>“Where’s the harm?” asked Case. “We’d
never get through there without a light.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you where the harm is,” the mountaineer
answered. “Them fellers you stirred up
back there at the settlement will shortly be sending
men out here to look you up. I shouldn’t be
surprised if they sent men with bloodhounds.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, then, we’ll have to do the best we
can in the dark,” Alex sighed, turning off the
light.</p>

<p>“Let me see that, will you?” asked Hank.</p>

<p>The mountaineer took the searchlight in his
great bony hand and examined it attentively,
switching the light on and off and turning it this
way and that, taking the precaution, however, to
hold the eye of the electric close to the ground.</p>

<p>“You Yankees,” he said presently, “will soon
be getting searchlights by wireless! It’s a pretty
good light, though, and I don’t object to it if you
do. How much might one of those contraptions
cost?” he added.</p>

<p>“All the way from four bits to four dollars,”
was the reply. “If you want a real large one, you
may go as high as fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy one when I bring down my next airplane,”
said the mountaineer, whimsically. “I
don’t doubt but that I could use it in my business.
I don’t suppose the wind would put that out, would
it? It’s mighty strong up there in the mountains
sometimes,” he added.</p>

<p>“No,” Case answered, “nothing will put that
light out until the battery becomes exhausted.
That is, unless you break the lamp.”</p>

<p>The boys were just starting on again when the
long terrifying baying of a hound came to their
ears. The dog was still a long distance off, yet
even as they listened his great voice came more
distinctly through the darkness.</p>

<p>“There!” Hank said in a disgusted tone of
voice, “they’ve gone and done it at last! It’s just
this way, boys,” he went on, “when you left that
old skinflint of a merchant back there, you were
two little boys sent out by a river pirate to see if
the town was worth plundering. Ten minutes after
your departure, you were two river pirates, armed
to the teeth and half drunk on moonshine whiskey.
Thirty minutes after you left, they were saying that
the town had been visited by a band of pirates
armed with cannons. By to-morrow morning, they
will have the town pillaged and burned. I never
did see the way people exaggerate things.”</p>

<p>“But where did they get that hound?” asked
Alex. “There wasn’t any there when we were
there.”</p>

<p>“They might have got one off of the Government
boat,” Hank answered.</p>

<p>“But there wasn’t any Government boat,” Alex
insisted.</p>

<p>“There was one just coming up the river,” said
the mountaineer. “If we ever come to the bank of
the stream we’ll see her pass up.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do about the dog?”
Case asked. “He’s evidently out of leash, for,
judging from the sound of his voice, he’s running
faster than any man could navigate through the
woods.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does seem to be out of leash,” the
mountaineer answered, “and it may be that he took
up the scent on his own hook. Still, the Federals
do have bloodhounds to aid in trailing the
moonshiners.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any way to get away from the
brute?” asked Case. “If we don’t, he’ll tree us
and set up such a howling that the men will be
thicker than bees around us in about an hour.”</p>

<p>“We can shoot him when he comes up,”
suggested the mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Seems too bad to kill the dog,” Alex observed.</p>

<p>“Besides all that,” Case went on, “we couldn’t
hit a barn in this darkness.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Hank suggested, “the thing for us to
do is to make for the river as fast as possible.
There’s always a good many skiffs and rowboats
scattered along on the Kentucky side. You see, if
we can only get to the water and pack ourselves
into a boat, we can sit and make faces at that hound
until Kingdom Come.”</p>

<p>Making what speed they could through the
thicket, stumbling over vines and protruding roots,
the boys proceeded on their way for a very few
moments. Then it became evident that the dog was
only a few rods away.</p>

<p>“Now that’s too bad,” Hank said, “we’ve got
to climb a tree, turn that bottled gas concern of
yours on the dog, and put a bullet plumb through
his head. I never did like to kill dogs, somehow.”</p>

<p>The dog came swiftly on, and it seemed to the
boys as if his voice could be heard for a thousand
miles. They were crouching in a thicket,
preparing to vault into the branches of a great beech tree
which stood near at hand, when a great commotion
was heard not far away. It seemed to them that
a wild hog, or a bear, or some heavy yet swift
denizen of the forest, awakened from his slumber by the
howling of the dog, had set out to make a swift
investigation of his own.</p>

<p>“What was that noise?” asked Alex, clutching
his new-found friend by the arm.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” Hank replied, “that sounded to me
like a dog going out to hold a little conversation
with that hound! It ran like a dog, and, besides, I
think I heard a succession of low growls as it
passed us.”</p>

<p>“Here’s hoping he keeps the hound so well
entertained that it won’t come any farther in this
direction!” Case said.</p>

<p>In a moment there came a great snarling and
growling from a thicket not far away, accompanied
by such a thumping and beating on the ground as
the boys had not heard in many a day. The baying
of the hound ceased entirely, and in a moment
only low choking pants of suffering were heard.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, boys!” the mountaineer
exclaimed, excitedly, “that thing that went through
here is either a bulldog or a wild hog. He’s
mixing it with the hound right now, and we may as
well go and see the scrap.”</p>

<p>Alex used his flashlight now without reproof.
The three pressed swiftly forward, the sounds of
conflict growing clearer as they advanced.
Directly they came to a great patch of bushes, from
the center of which the commotion came.</p>

<p>In spite of the protests of the others, Alex
pushed his way into the jungle and turned his
searchlight on two objects struggling desperately
on the ground. The next moment they heard his
voice crying out joyfully:</p>

<p>“It’s Captain Joe! It’s Captain Joe!” he said.</p>

<p>“What has he done to the hound?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“Who’s Captain Joe?” demanded the mountaineer.</p>

<p>Alex answered the two questions by dragging
the white bulldog out of the thicket by the collar.
His jaws were smeared with blood, and he limped
slightly on one fore leg.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe,” Alex replied, “is the gamiest
bulldog that ever lived, and there ain’t enough left
of that hound to bait a trap with.</p>

<p>“Where did the bulldog come from?” demanded
Hank.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Alex exclaimed. “That’s just exactly
what I want to know.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI.—JULE TURNS THE SWITCH.</h2>

<p class='first'>“I don’t believe,” Jule said, throwing himself
off his bunk in a moment, “that the <i>Rambler</i> has
made successful trips on the Amazon, the Columbia,
the Colorado, the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence
to become lost on an inland river like the
Ohio! In some way, we’re going to get out of this
scrape and continue our journey.”</p>

<p>The boy sat down by the little stationary table
in the cabin and studied out the problem in his
own boyish way. There were police boats on the
river, and eventually the attention of some captain
would be attracted to a splendid motor boat like
the <i>Rambler</i> in the hands of a couple of river
toughs.</p>

<p>Besides, the <i>Rambler</i> was entirely unmanageable,
and would doubtless soon bring up against a sand
bar or a mass of wreckage. In this case the first
boat coming within sight would undoubtedly stop
to inquire the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>Thus reasoning himself into a more hopeful state
of mind, the boy went out onto the little deck and
watched Gid and Mike panting and sweating at the
oars and sweep in their vain efforts to keep the
<i>Rambler</i> off a sand bar which lifted its white
surface above the river on the Kentucky side.</p>

<p>For a time the men succeeded fairly well, but the
current set directly toward the bar, which was, in
fact, one of its creatures, and the <i>Rambler</i> soon
thrust her nose into the firm sand with a shock and
shiver which seemed to loosen every rivet and bolt.</p>

<p>Gid rattled the oar he had been using down on
the deck and wiped his streaming brow with a dirty
hand. Mike sat down on the gunwale and swore
earnestly and with originality.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?” Mike asked in a moment.</p>

<p>Gid shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“If we don’t get off this everlasting sand bar
before daylight,” Mike said in a moment, “there’ll
be a procession of river boats up here to know
what’s wrong. They’ll all be wanting to pull us
off, and they’ll all be wanting a pocketful of money
for doing it. Have you got any money, Gid?”</p>

<p>“Have I got any money?” repeated Gid. “If
the whole world was selling for a dollar, I couldn’t
buy dirt enough to stop a watch! I was lucky
enough to get out of Louisville with a whole skin.
What did you do with your money?” he asked,
looking Mike keenly in the eye.</p>

<p>“I bought lottery tickets with mine,” Mike
replied. “I’ve got the lottery tickets in my pocket
yet, and I never have any luck when I have the
things around. Honest, Gid,” the Irishman
continued, “I’ve carried lottery tickets in my clothes
for five years, and during all that time no band ever
played in front of me on the street. And that’s a
fact, if you want to know!”</p>

<p>“Mike,” Gid observed with a smile, “do you
study the dream book every night and morning?
You’re as superstitious as an old woman!”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Gid,” continued Mike.
“That’s the exact truth I told you about those
lottery tickets. Look here, now, here’s an illustration.
I was standing on South Clark street, Chicago, one
morning with three Louisiana lottery tickets in
my pocket. There was a procession coming down
the street with twenty bands in it. And I said to
the boys who were with me that I would bet the
cigars for the crowd that there wouldn’t a band
play when passing the spot where we stood.”</p>

<p>“You got your nerve to bet on a hoodoo,” Gid
laughed.</p>

<p>Jule was now becoming interested in the
conversation, which he had heard from his position at
the prow, and drew closer to the two men. He
noticed that they used remarkably good language,
and also that they seemed to know Chicago well,
so he resolved that he would try to learn more about
them as soon as an opportunity offered.</p>

<p>“That lottery ticket hoodoo is one that is safe
to bet on at any spot in the road,” Mike continued.
“Well, as I was saying, there was a procession
coming up South Clark street with twenty bands
in it, and I was betting there wouldn’t a band play
in front of the spot where we stood. This was on
account of the lottery tickets I had in my pocket.
I was just plumb hoodooed with those tickets.
Why, look here!” he continued, “if I had thrown
those tickets overboard, we wouldn’t be on this sand
bar now. I tell you they have just plumb hoodooed
me. I think I’ll throw them overboard now.”</p>

<p>“What about the twenty bands and the
procession?” asked Jule, with a grin on his face.
“Tell me about that.”</p>

<p>“Hello, kid!” Mike said with a chuckle. “Did
you hear me talking that fool stuff about the
lottery tickets?”</p>

<p>“Sure I did,” Jule answered.</p>

<p>“Well, you take warning by me and don’t ever
buy any!” Mike declared.</p>

<p>“Well, what about these twenty bands?” Jule
insisted.</p>

<p>“Sho’, of course, I nearly forgot all about the
bands. Well nineteen bands passed our corner
without a note of music. Walked by just like they
were going up the street in a political parade. You
know, son,” Mike continued, “that musicians think
they are paid to walk in parades on account of their
uniforms, and not on account of their music.”</p>

<p>“What did you say these twenty bands did?”
laughed Jule.</p>

<p>“Nineteen marched plumb by without ever
blowing a horn. The twentieth one started in half a
block below us. I just had a notion then that that
band was going to play, and that I would have to
buy the cigars, and then I thought that one of the
tickets might draw a prize so I wasn’t kicking any.
Well, sir, do you know that that big band headed
up to us in full tune.”</p>

<p>“So you had to buy the cigars?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Did I have to buy the cigars?” repeated Mike.
“Say, kid, twenty feet below us a horse hitched
to a carriage filled with ladies reared up on his hind
feet and they had to stop the music until they got
by us so as not to frighten the horse any more.
You bet I don’t have to buy the cigars on any bet
like that!”</p>

<p>Encouraged by the friendly voice and manner of
the Irishman, Jule asked what they intended doing
with the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s just this way, boy,” Mike replied, “we’ve
been skinned and cleaned up, and knocked out, in
every enterprise we ever undertook. We’re both
printers, and used to work on the old Chicago
Herald when Jim Scott owned it. Well, we beat
the faro bank until we didn’t have a cent. We
played poker and roulette until the other fellows
held a mortgage on our pay envelopes. So we’re
just plumb disgusted with civilization. We haven’t
got the brains to become city pirates and run
gambling houses and elect aldermen and all that, but
we have got muscle enough to become river pirates,
so here we are, and here your boat is.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep the boat?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Of course, we’re going to keep it!” Mike declared.</p>

<p>“You bet we are!” Gid put in. “No man we
ever played with ever gave us any Christmas
presents after he’d cleaned us out.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Jule announced, “I’ll set up a yell the
first boat comes near us and your hoodoo lottery
tickets will probably land you in jail.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be rough with you, kid,”
Mike went on, “but when you see a boat coming
if you don’t hustle into the cabin and go to bed and
cover up your head and ears, we’ll take the hide off
your back in long, wide strips.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!” Jule answered with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Mike answered, “we’re
pretty good fellows, but we’re just plumb disgusted
with everything in the world. Now, really,” he
went on, “this boat belongs to that pirate gang
over there, and we stole it from them. We didn’t
steal it from you. We’re innocent bystanders, as
it were.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t the <i>Hawk</i> come over here and
get you?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly,” replied Mike, “but it
is my idea that there is a police boat somewhere in
sight. We can’t see around the bend, and so
wouldn’t know if one was coming, but the <i>Hawk</i>,
lying nearer to the other shore, would know it
right quick.”</p>

<p>“I hope there is a police boat coming!” Jule
said.</p>

<p>“Well, when you see one, you duck into that
cabin,” Mike ordered, “and do it mighty quick.
No Federal officer would believe your word against
ours, so you wouldn’t gain anything by making a
fool of yourself.”</p>

<p>The <i>Hawk</i> did seem to be acting strangely. It
was now deep twilight and yet she could be seen
lying over near the Indiana shore, her great bulk
dim against the gathering darkness. Not a light
was to be seen on board. Not a sound was to be
heard.</p>

<p>“I reckon there is a police boat coming,” Gid
said, after a short pause, “but if we lie right still
and don’t show any lights, she’ll pass on the other
side. Anyway, she can’t help seeing the <i>Hawk</i>,
and she’ll go there first.”</p>

<p>Half an hour passed and it grew dark on the
river. Clouds were driving over the valley, and
it was likely to be a rainy night. A wind came up
the river as the darkness increased, and the moaning
of the trees and the rush of the waters made
conversation quite difficult, even when the parties
stood close together, as the three did on the deck of
the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>Jule stepped back to the cabin entrance and stood
close to the electric switch which controlled the
strong searchlight on the prow. Mike and Gid
stood leaning over the gunwale, their eyes fixed
intently on the bulk of the <i>Hawk</i>, now almost lost
in the darkness. A faint light, something like that
of a candle or a small kerosene lamp, now showed
on the freight deck of the river pirate.</p>

<p>“There’s a Government boat coming up the
river, and that’s no dream!” Gid cried.</p>

<p>“There’s no other way to account for the mighty
strange actions of the captain of the <i>Hawk</i>,” Mike
responded.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if we keep all lights out and lie
perfectly still, the police boat won’t see us!” the other
suggested.</p>

<p>The two men stood long at the gunwale, watching
the pirate boat as long as the falling night
permitted. Jule, too, remained on deck, standing by
the switch which controlled the searchlight.</p>

<p>Once or twice, when the sound of a steam exhaust
came from below, he put his hand to the
switch, but always drew it away again when no
lights showed over the dark river. He was waiting
until the right moment.</p>

<p>Directly a sharp whistle sounded from below,
and then the lights of a steamer flashed into view
around the bend. Jule put his hand to the switch
but brought it away once more when the lights
turned toward the <i>Hawk</i>, still lying near the
Indiana shore, motionless.</p>

<p>“Now,” Mike said in a moment, “if we could
only get this consarned boat off this idiotic bar,
we’d be able to slide out of sight while that
gold-laced officer is listening to the lies the
captain of the <i>Hawk</i> will tell him. Prime liar,
that fellow is!”</p>

<p>Standing on the deck with all close individual
sounds shut out by the wash of the waters and the
roaring of the trees, they saw the steamer head
directly toward the <i>Hawk</i>, then in a moment the
pirate craft was ablaze with light.</p>

<p>“Crafty chap, that captain!” Mike declared.
“He knows he’s been observed, and so lights up.”</p>

<p>Jule could wait no longer. With one motion of
his hand, he turned the switch and the strong prow
light flashed out over the river. Gid sprang toward
the boy with a leveled revolver.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII.—THE TRAINING OF TEDDY.</h2>

<p class='first'>“You confounded idiot!” shouted Mike, catching
his companion by the arm. “Do you want to
bring that police boat over here inside of two
minutes? If you do, just fire that gun.”</p>

<p>“Look what he did!” almost panted Gid, in a
heat of rage. “He turned on the light, and they’ll
be over here as soon as they get done with the
<i>Hawk</i>.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped now!” declared Mike.</p>

<p>During this short conversation Jule stood regarding
the men intently, his face pale but his eyes
flashing with the spirit of defiance which was in his
heart. Mike regarded him whimsically.</p>

<p>“Will you turn out the light?” he asked. “Or
shall I smash it?”</p>

<p>“Turn it out yourself!” ordered Gid, “if you
know where the switch is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where the switch is,” Mike replied.</p>

<p>“Then coax the boy to turn it out,” sneered Gid.
“He seems to be a special friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“Turn it out kid,” advised Mike.</p>

<p>Jule, realizing that the light must already have
accomplished the purpose intended, turned the
switch and the <i>Rambler</i> was again in darkness.
He realized that the light would be extinguished
whether he turned the switch or not, for the lamp
could be easily broken.</p>

<p>“Now, boy,” Gid thundered in Jule’s ear, “you
get into that cabin and stay there. If any of these
sneaking Government officials come on board,
you’re sick! Do you understand that? You’re sick
abed! And we’re your good, kind protectors!
Understand that? If you ain’t good and sick while
they’re here, you’ll be ailing in earnest as soon as
they go away.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jule answered, “I’ll go into the
cabin now and lie down. But, look here,” he
continued, “I’d like to have you gentlemen make me
a promise. Will you?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mike, not unkindly.</p>

<p>It was very dark now, and they could not see
each other’s faces, especially as the glare of the
light during its brief presence had in a manner
dazzled their eyes. Perhaps this was just as well,
for Gid would not have liked the look on Mike’s
face as he spoke to the boy. It was all sympathy
and feeling.</p>

<p>“Well,” Jule said, with a low chuckle, “when
you’re hanged for murder or piracy, I’d like to
have you invite me to the festival.”</p>

<p>Gid uttered a snarl of rage and struck at the boy
but Mike only laughed as Jule dodged the blow,
only indistinctly seen, and, entering the cabin,
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“They forget,” he thought to himself, “that
there are lights in the cabin which, when turned,
will reveal the presence of the <i>Rambler</i>. Anyway,”
he added, “I believe the Government officers saw
the searchlight. I don’t see how they could have
missed seeing it.”</p>

<p>Teddy, the quarter-grown grizzly bear, now
rubbed a soft muzzle against the boy’s hand, as if
in sympathy, and nestled close to his side.</p>

<p>“Teddy,” Jule said, “you and I have been captured
by pirates. Captain Joe has gone off to find
Alex, and we’re here in the possession of a couple
of Desperate Desmonds. We want to get away.
Now what would you suggest?”</p>

<p>In the darkness the boy knew that Teddy was
sitting up on his hind feet suggesting a boxing
match.</p>

<p>“That’s the thing, Teddy,” Jule said, speaking
into the bear’s ear, as if in belief that the cub
understood every word he said. “That’s just the
thing! You suggest a fight, and that’s just what
it’s got to be.”</p>

<p>The boy and the bear sat together in the cabin
for a long time. Through the window on the
starboard side the boy could see the lights of the
Government boat and the lights of the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>There seemed to be some commotion on board
the pirate boat, and the boy at one time thought he
detected the sound of a pistol shot.</p>

<p>“After they get done with those river robbers,”
Jule thought, “they will probably be over here to
see why the <i>Rambler</i>’s light died out so quickly.
Now, what shall I do when they come?”</p>

<p>The boy failed to reach any conclusion regarding
future actions. The correct course seemed to
be to be guided entirely by circumstances. If
the officers came aboard he must find some way of
notifying them of the true condition of affairs. If
they did not come aboard, he must, again, attract
their attention.</p>

<p>After half an hour or more the Government boat
turned toward the <i>Rambler</i> and directly the boy
heard a call.</p>

<p>“Hello, the boat!”</p>

<p>“Come aboard!” Mike’s voice answered.</p>

<p>“Send a boat!” ordered the officer.</p>

<p>“We’re stranded on a bar,” Mike returned.
“Can’t you-help us off?”</p>

<p>The boy could hear the rattle of a boat against
the hull of the Government steamer, and then the
creaking of oars. Just then the cabin door opened
and Gid made his appearance, his bulky form
clearly shown in the light from the steamer which
came through the cabin window.</p>

<p>“Now, boy,” Gid said, “the Government officers
are coming on board. Buckle down on the bunk
and keep your mouth closed.”</p>

<p>The fellow enforced his command with a revolver,
and Jule hastened to do as ordered.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Gold-Lace comes into the cabin,” Gid
went on, “I’ll be setting here peaceful like with the
lights turned on. You’ll be over there in the bunk
sound asleep. If you make a move or open your
lips, I’ll shoot you full of holes. See?” he added,
thrusting one hand into his right pocket and
pushing the muzzle of a revolver out against the cloth,
“I can do some pretty good shooting from a
pocket.”</p>

<p>Jule started to speak, but Gid lifted a heavy
hand for silence.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gold-Lace is coming on board,” he said,
“now mind what I’ve been telling you.”</p>

<p>Jule lay still under the blanket he had drawn
over his shoulders and chuckled softly to himself.</p>

<p>“Teddy,” he laughed, “Teddy will be taking that
fellow by the leg in a minute and then there’ll be
doings! Just wait till that officer gets on board,”
the boy’s busy brain went on, “and I’ll get that
pirate into a boxing match with the bear.”</p>

<p>It was true that Gid had not observed the bear,
for Jule had motioned him into a dark corner as
soon as the pirate’s hulking figure had shown in the
doorway.</p>

<p>Presently Gid arose to his feet and looked out of
the glass panel in the cabin door.</p>

<p>“There’s two coming aboard,” he said turning
toward the boy.</p>

<p>“Are you going to put me on the reception
committee?” asked Jule, with a snicker.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that you’ve got anything to laugh
at!” Gid declared.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the odds?” Jule demanded. “The
<i>Rambler</i> is a mascot, and always was. You can’t
do anything to her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do something to you!” declared Gid, “if
you don’t keep that mouth closed.”</p>

<p>“You don’t dare!” returned Jule. “If you
touch me I’ll yell like a loon, and then the officers
will come running in here, and that’ll be your
finish. You’d better go out on deck.”</p>

<p>Gid did go out on deck, arriving just in time to
greet two Government officers as they stepped on
board the <i>Rambler</i>. This formality over, the
fellow backed up against the cabin door and stood
facing the light now burning at the prow. The
cabin door was open, and the boy could hear nearly
every word that was spoken on deck, the wind
having in a measure died out.</p>

<p>“What’s your boat?” he heard an officer ask.</p>

<p>“<i>Rambler</i>, Chicago,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Whither bound?”</p>

<p>“New Orleans,” was the quick answer.</p>

<p>“Who have you on board?” was the next question.</p>

<p>Jule saw Mike point with a hairy fist toward
the cabin.</p>

<p>“Only a kid,” he said, “back there in the cabin
shaking his bones to pieces with the ague.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been on this bar?” asked
the official.</p>

<p>“We struck it just before dark,” answered Mike,
who really was doing a very good job in the way
of convincing the officer that everything was all
right and straight on board the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“There are a good many motor boats doing
illicit business up and down the river,” suggested the
official.</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied Mike. “We’re afraid some
of them will come along while we are tied up on
this bar.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Lost a spark plug,” was the reply. “At first
we limped along in fairly good shape, and then the
others had to go bad with us. Honest,” he
continued, “I don’t think we’ll ever get off this sand
bar unless you give us a line.”</p>

<p>“I’ll gladly do that,” said the officer, “and I’ll
do more. I’ll send over half a dozen spark plugs.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of you,” Mike suggested. “We’ll
be glad to pay for them. It is a great accommodation
to us.”</p>

<p>Jule snickered in his bunk, for he had recently
heard the two men talking about being absolutely
penniless. Observing that Gid was not watching
him very closely, the latter’s attention being
directed to the two men standing forward, the boy
beckoned to Teddy, who came shambling up to the
side of the bunk and laid a soft paw against the
boy’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Now, Teddy,” Jule said, “we’re going to play
a trick on those men out there. Do you think you
can do a boxing stunt to-night?”</p>

<p>Teddy sat up on his haunches at mention of
the word “boxing” and admitted in perfectly
good bear talk that he could.</p>

<p>“You just wait, Teddy,” Jule went on, “until
that police boat draws the <i>Rambler</i> off this bar and
supplies her with spark plugs, and we’ll give a
show that will beat any four-ring circus that ever
traveled out of Chicago. It’ll be something worth
buying a ticket to.”</p>

<p>After some further conversation the Government
officers returned to their steamer. A cable was
carried to the motor boat and in a minute she was
floating in free water.</p>

<p>“Now,” called an officer from the stern of the
steamer, “bend on that manilla hawser to your
spare anchor and throw it out.”</p>

<p>Mike obeyed instructions to the letter, and the
<i>Rambler</i> was soon swinging easily with her grip
on the bottom of the river.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a favor coming from us now,”
Mike shouted, “if the time ever comes when we
can render you one! Shall I come aboard for the
spark plugs?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got any rowboat,” Gid reminded
his companion.</p>

<p>In the end the steamer dropped down and the
spark plugs were tossed aboard, being caught deftly
by the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mike with a grin, “we’ll fix up
these motors and get down toward New Orleans
at a right smart gait.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask the officer about the
<i>Hawk</i>?” demanded Gid.</p>

<p>“Oh, that old captain lied himself clear, all
right,” Mike answered. “Don’t you see that the
<i>Hawk</i> lies there with her lights all going and the
Government steamer is going on up the river?”</p>

<p>Gid turned to Jule with something like a smile
on his sullen face.</p>

<p>Jule was standing by the closed cabin door with
the bear fully instructed and trained, brushing
against the inside of it.</p>

<p>“Well, boy,” Gid said, “you did remarkably
well during the visit of the officers, so we’re going
to let you get us something to eat. While we fix
the motors, you cook up some supper and we’ll soon
be sailing down the river as happy and contented
as three peas in a pod. I presume you’ve got
plenty of provisions on board.”</p>

<p>“You bet we have!” answered Jule happily.
“I’ll get you a supper that’ll make your mouth
water.”</p>

<p>The boy knew that while preparing the meal he
would be tolerably free from the surveillance of
the two men. This would give him an opportunity
to bring a couple of revolvers from the
cupboard where they were kept, and also to confer with
Teddy as to the course to be pursued.</p>

<p>“Now, Teddy,” the boy said, as he went into
the cabin and shut the door, “I don’t know what
to do to these men. Sometimes I think I’ll drug
their coffee, and sometimes I think I’ll give them
a scare that will make their heads look like the top
of a snow-capped mountain.”</p>

<p>The bear turned his head thoughtfully to one
side and expressed the rather selfish opinion that
he thought a boxing match would be about the
best thing under the circumstances. The bear had
had boxing matches with river pirates before that
night, and he knew pretty well what to do when
the boys set him going on strangers.</p>

<p>“If I drug their coffee,” Jule went on, “they’ll
go to sleep and we’ll have them on our hands. If
I give them a scare, they’ll jump into the river and
that’ll be the last of them.”</p>

<p>Looking out of the window the boy now saw
the Government steamer disappearing rapidly
upstream. He also saw the <i>Hawk</i> turning her prow
in the direction of the <i>Rambler</i>. Mike and Gid
stood by the port gunwale talking earnestly in low
tones.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s trouble brewing that I wasn’t
counting on,” the boy said dejectedly. “Teddy
and I can’t fight the whole bunch.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII.—CAPTAIN JOE’S MESSAGE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Where do you think the bulldog came from?”
asked Hank as, with Alex and Case, he stood
watching the dog capering about in the joy of victory.
“He seems to know you boys pretty well.”</p>

<p>“This dog,” Alex answered, “is the champion
four-footed traveler of the world. He’s been on
all the big rivers, and in all the big cities. He’s
taken bites out of all the tribes on the face of the
globe. He belongs on the <i>Rambler</i> with us.”</p>

<p>“Seems like a mighty pert dog?” admitted the
mountaineer.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to guess again!” Case put in.</p>

<p>“Anyway, he done finished that hound in good
shape,” Hank suggested.</p>

<p>He stooped as he spoke and took the end of a
rope into his fingers.</p>

<p>“You see how it is,” he said, “the animal broke
his leash and got away from the bunch sleuthing in
the woods.”</p>

<p>“Then they won’t be able to find us?” asked
Alex.</p>

<p>The bony mountaineer shook his head.</p>

<p>“They might as well look for a needle in a load
of hay,” he said.</p>

<p>Alex now bent over and began talking gravely
to the bulldog.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe,” he said, “why didn’t you follow
me sooner? I might have been eaten alive at
that landing. Next time, you come quicker.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe pointed his blood-stained nose in the
direction of the river and whined softly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>The dog drew away from the boy and ran a few
steps to the north and looked back.</p>

<p>“Look here!” Alex said, speaking excitedly to
Case and the mountaineer, “the bulldog says
there’s some of our friends over in the direction of
the river.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear him talking,” laughed the mountaineer.</p>

<p>“That’s because you don’t know dog talk.
Captain Joe has a language of his own,” laughed Case.
“Great dog, that!”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” admitted the mountaineer, “he
seems to understand what you say to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” urged Alex. “Let’s don’t
waste any more time standing here. There’s something
wrong on board the <i>Rambler</i>, or Captain Joe
wouldn’t be here.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Rambler</i>,” Case insisted, “is a long way
upstream.”</p>

<p>“I guess Captain Joe knows where it is,” Alex
replied. “You fellows come right along. I’m going
to follow the dog.”</p>

<p>The boys used their searchlights freely now, and
made considerable noise making their way through
the thickets. After walking steadily for fifteen
or twenty minutes, the bulldog darted on ahead and
left them to make their way without his guidance.</p>

<p>Even while the three were discussing the disappearance
of the dog, they heard him barking not
far away, and then a voice they knew came to their
ears. The dog’s bark took on a note of welcome.</p>

<p>“Hello, Alex! Hello, Case!” they heard Clay
call. “Why don’t you come on out to the river?”
“We’re moving as fast as we can,” Case called
back. “This jungle is harder to work through
than a Saturday night crowd on South Clark street.
How did you come to be on shore?” he added.</p>

<p>By this time, the two boys and the mountaineer
had gained the spot where Clay stood.</p>

<p>“What’s doing on the <i>Rambler</i>?” Case asked
after the mountaineer had been presented to Clay.</p>

<p>“We have met the enemy and we are theirs!”
said Clay dolefully.</p>

<p>In as few words as possible he told the story
of the situation on the <i>Rambler</i> at the time he left
it.</p>

<p>“And Jule is still there with those thieves?”
asked Case.</p>

<p>“He is unless he’s made a dive for liberty,” replied
Clay.</p>

<p>“You say the boat was drifting the last you saw
of her?” asked Hank.</p>

<p>“Broadside downstream!” answered Clay.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” the mountaineer suggested, “we’d
better be moving on down. Was she on this side
of the river or the other?”</p>

<p>“Pretty close to the Kentucky shore,” answered
the boy.</p>

<p>“Then you’re in luck!” the mountaineer
laughed. “There’s a sand bar down here, just
around the point, that will be sure to catch her.
You may have my head for a football if we don’t
see her wedged against that bar as soon as we come
in sight of it.”</p>

<p>After half an hour’s difficult walking along the
river bank, winding far into the river to escape
coves, crossing little runs on fallen trees, they
passed around the point of the bend and looked
down a long sweep of river.</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” shouted the mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think of that?” demanded
Clay.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” Alex and Case declared in a breath.
What the boys saw was the <i>Rambler</i> lying at
anchor, perhaps forty rods away with the <i>Hawk</i>
bearing down upon her.</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” the mountaineer said, “as if
those pirates were bound to have that boat.”</p>

<p>“And it looks to me,” Case put in, “as if they’re
going to get her, too! They seem to have the top
hand in this game.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” declared the mountaineer.
“I don’t think we ought to let those brigands
run away with that boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, suggest something!” urged Clay.</p>

<p>Before Hank could speak again, the <i>Rambler</i>’s
anchor was hauled in and she was headed directly
for the shore almost at the exact spot where the
four stood. The <i>Hawk</i> steamed steadily after her.</p>

<p>“What’s she doing that for?” demanded Case.</p>

<p>“That boat of yours,” suggested the mountaineer,
“will almost float in a heavy dew, while the
<i>Hawk</i> as you call her requires a considerable depth
of water.”</p>

<p>Clay nudged his companions and laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s shows that you’re not familiar with
boating,” he said, in a moment. “That old barge
out there will float in twenty-five inches of water,
while the <i>Rambler</i>, sticking her keel down like a
knife, requires at least thirty-five inches. I guess
the truth of the matter is,” he added, “that the
pirates on board the <i>Rambler</i> are coming this way
in the hope of dodging the <i>Hawk</i>.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they do a little shooting?” Case
asked. “Those fellows aren’t usually so saving of
their ammunition.”</p>

<p>“I guess the police boat isn’t far away,”
suggested the mountaineer. “She may be just
downstream, or just upstream, but they know she’s
hereabouts, and there’d be plenty of shooting if they
didn’t suspect her presence. Those fellows usually
shoot to kill, too.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> came in within a dozen feet of the
shore and then turned prow down. The <i>Hawk</i>
dropped down, too, edging in upon her every minute.
The boys watched the maneuvers with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“I hope they won’t get to shooting,” Clay said,
“because Jule and Teddy must be still on board.”</p>

<p>“If those fellows on the <i>Rambler</i> knew the
game they are playing,” Alex declared, “they
would turn the motors on full speed and run away
from that pirate. Perhaps they don’t know it, but
our boat can go three miles while the other boat is
traveling one.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go aboard and show them how to run it!”
suggested Case.</p>

<p>The prow light was still burning on the <i>Rambler</i>,
and the cabin was also brightly illuminated.
Through the small window on the port side, they
could see Jule busily engaged over the electric coils
at the back of the cabin.</p>

<p>“I believe I can get on board that boat without
being seen,” Alex declared, and before the
others could offer a word of remonstrance, the
little fellow was in the river swimming mostly under
water toward the after deck of the motor boat.
They saw him climb up on the deck and peer in at
the window in the rear wall of the cabin.</p>

<p>“The little monkey!” chuckled Clay. “I don’t
think I would have undertaken a game of that kind
for a million dollars.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case said excitedly, “we’re going to
do exactly the same thing. Those fellows on board
are so busy watching the pirates that they won’t
see us, and the pirates are so busy watching the
<i>Rambler</i> that they won’t see us. We’ve just got to
get on board.”</p>

<p>The mountaineer threw himself at full length on
the ground and laughed until his lean sides shook.</p>

<p>“And what will you do when you get on
board?” he asked directly. “You’re the gamest
lot of kids I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“About the first thing I do,” Case declared, “will
be to get something to eat. I’ll just bet you a red
apple that Alex has got his nose into the provision
chest this minute.”</p>

<p>They all glanced toward the <i>Rambler</i> at mention
of the boy and saw that the after deck was vacant.</p>

<p>“It’s a sure thing he’s got his nose into some
kind of food if he’s inside the cabin,” Clay remarked.</p>

<p>“But, honest, now, boys,” the mountaineer
asked, “what do you think of doing after you get
on board? You can’t fight the pirates on your boat
and the pirates on the <i>Hawk</i> too.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay said, “we’ll run away from that
boat in a minute. In three seconds after we get
our hands on the motors, we’ll be going so fast
downstream that a bullet from the <i>Hawk</i> couldn’t
catch us.”</p>

<p>“You kids certainly beat my time,” chuckled
the mountaineer. “If I didn’t have plenty of
business at that little aeroplane factory of mine up in
the hills. I’d be tempted to go with you.”</p>

<p>“This man,” Case explained to Clay, “makes
moonshine whiskey up in the hills. He calls his
still an aeroplane factory because his product sends
people up in the air.”</p>

<p>“It will send a man pretty high up in the air if
he drinks enough of it,” the mountaineer chuckled.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you quit it and play fair with the
Government?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Sho’, boys,” answered the mountaineer, “I
wouldn’t enjoy life if it wasn’t for the skirmishes
I have with the Government officers. Besides, there
ain’t nothing else a man can do in this country.
When a man can make a hundred dollars’ worth of
moonshine out of ten dollars’ worth of corn, and
do it with mighty little trouble, what’s the use of
his coming down into the valley and shoveling coal
into a steamer for a dollar and a half a day?”</p>

<p>The argument was never completed, for at that
moment the boys saw the cabin door open and
Teddy, standing erect in a boxing attitude, move
out. He was getting to be quite a good-sized bear
now, and he bulked fierce and heavy against the
lights. At first, neither one of the river thieves on
board the <i>Rambler</i> saw him.</p>

<p>In fact, the first indication Mike had of his
presence was when he felt a sharp claw laid on the arm
lying across the gunwale. He turned quickly,
looked for one instant into the pig-like eyes of the
bear, and with a cry which echoed down the river,
sprang into the stream.</p>

<p>“I guess he thought the bear was going to eat
him!” Case observed.</p>

<p>The mountaineer now lay rolling and tumbling
on the bank of the river. The scene had opened so
unexpectedly; the bear’s appearance had been so
fierce and intimidating, that he had at first felt a
little shiver of fear, but now he saw that the bear
was merely performing tricks he had been taught
While he chuckled, Gid also leaped into the river,
and then he saw Case and Clay, followed by
Captain Joe, swimming lustily toward the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX.—THE THREE BLUE LIGHTS.</h2>

<p class='first'>The entire situation on board the <i>Rambler</i> had
not been observed from the shore. The boys and
the mountaineer had seen only Teddy in the center
of the stage, so they had naturally supposed that
the swift departure of the pirates had been
occasioned by the sudden appearance of the grizzly.
Had they been in a little different position, they
would have seen Alex and Jule standing in the
open doorway of the cabin with threatening automatics
in their hands.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s a funny proposition,” the mountaineer
deliberated, as Clay and Case clambered to
the after deck. “Them pirates are watching the
<i>Rambler</i>, and yet they don’t see that the boys are
getting possession of her. They must be a stupid
lot.”</p>

<p>The next minute, however, convinced the
mountaineer that he had been mistaken in his estimate of
the intelligence of the pirates. Half a dozen pistol
shots came in quick succession, making little spurts
of water on the surface of the river near the stern
of the boat. However, Clay and Case were soon
climbing, dripping with river water, through the
window at the rear of the cabin.</p>

<p>Still watching from the shore, the mountaineer
saw Clay creep up to the bridge deck which
concealed the motors, keeping down below the level
of the gunwale. Bullets from the <i>Hawk</i> continued
to spatter about the motor boat, but seemed to do
no damage whatever.</p>

<p>As those who have read the previous volumes of
this series will understand, the entire exterior walls
of the <i>Rambler</i> were sheathed with bullet-proof
steel. This fact, it will be remembered, had preserved
the lives of all the boys during the voyage
to the head waters of the Amazon river.</p>

<p>Directly the watcher saw the anchor, which had
been dropped again when the boat had taken her
position near the shore, lifted and the next instant,
the motor boat went gliding like a shot downstream.</p>

<p>The moonshiner bent his head forward and
rubbed his eyes in wonder. It was all new to him,
this wonderful speed. His acquaintance with
motor boats had consisted almost entirely of a
slight knowledge of the large flat-bottomed scows
hardly worthy the name of motor boats. When the
<i>Rambler</i> darted away at a speed not less than
twenty miles an hour, it all seemed to him like
magic.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment on the bank watching the
little spurts of flame shooting from the <i>Hawk</i> and
then turned into the thicket with a chuckle which
shook his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>“Sho’,” he exclaimed, “we mountaineers don’t
know much about river folks, after all. I never
knew there was anything on the face of the earth
that could go as fast as that motor boat went.”</p>

<p>He tramped along in the darkness for a long
time and then stopped and made a small fire, by
the side of which he slept until morning. With
the appearance of the day he was out toward the
hills, and also forever out of the lives of those on
board the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Now, see here,” Clay suggested as the Rambler
speeded beyond reach of the bullets from the
<i>Hawk</i>, “we can’t long keep this gait with empty
gasoline tanks.”</p>

<p>“If we pull in at the landing just below here,”
Alex laughed, “we’ll all get pinched. If you leave
it to that old store keeper, we’re pirates, and Case
and I are little rhinoceros birds sent on ahead to
see whether the picking is good.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay continued, “we don’t have to
strain the motors right now, so we’ll keep just
enough gasoline burning to give us headway.
Perhaps we’ll strike a more hospitable settlement
farther down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that old fellow had any
gasoline to sell, anyhow,” laughed Case. “If you boys
could have seen the rubes fall all over each other
when we pulled our automatics, you’d have nearly
died laughing!”</p>

<p>“Suppose we stop and see how they feel about
the matter to-night,” suggested Alex. “I’d like to
drag that constable out of bed!”</p>

<p>“No use of looking for trouble,” Clay advised.
“After all, you must remember that those fellows
have the law on their side.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case declared, “and if they could once
get us into jail they’d keep us there for years.
They’re likely good and angry about the way we
bluffed them before their own townspeople.”</p>

<p>Teddy now came up to where the boys were
standing and demanded appreciation for the part he
had played in the recapture of the boat. Captain
Joe, also, advised the boys of his presence by
nipping them quietly on the legs.</p>

<p>“I know what’s the matter with the menagerie,”
Alex exclaimed. “They haven’t had any supper.
And that makes me think,” he went on, making a
dive for the cabin, “that I haven’t had any supper,
either.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to get for supper?” Clay
asked, following the boy to the cabin door.</p>

<p>“Oh,” Alex replied with a grin which wrinkled
his freckled nose, “it’s almost midnight now, and
we’ll just get a light little luncheon.”</p>

<p>“You make lots of bad breaks trying to talk the
English language,” Case advised. “You mustn’t
say ‘luncheon’ unless you have pie. It’s ‘lunch’
when you don’t have pie, and ‘luncheon’ when you
do have pie.”</p>

<p>“I said ‘luncheon’, didn’t I?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“You certainly did,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex said, “then we’re going to have
pie.</p>

<p>“The only kind of pie we can have now,” Case
objected, “is fish pie. I’ll go and catch a couple of
river perch and you can make a fish pie.”</p>

<p>“Say, look here,” Alex said, shutting the cabin
door in Case’s face and talking through the glass
panel, “what do you know about pie? I suppose
you’ll be wanting me to make a liver pie next.”</p>

<p>“That would be fine fodder!” laughed Case. “I
guess you are joking!”</p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten about those canned apples,”
Alex insisted. “I’m going to make hot apple pie
for our midnight luncheon. And we’re going to
have ham and eggs, and potatoes, and soda biscuit,
and a whole lot of good things.”</p>

<p>“Go to it!” grinned Case, as he went back on
the prow and sat down to watch the river.</p>

<p>The boat slipped steadily down with the current
for about an hour before any lights were seen on the
Kentucky side. Then Clay got out his map of the
river and they all examined it intently.</p>

<p>“Here’s the big bend below Brandenburg,” Case
said with his finger on the representation of the
river. “Just now, we are free of the big bend, and
so that light on the south bank must be at Wolf
Creek.”</p>

<p>“Je-rusalem!” Jule exclaimed. “The name
sounds fierce, all right!”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Clay went on, “there’s a little stream
enters the Ohio at Wolf Creek, and we can tie up
there until morning. If they haven’t got any gasoline
there, we can shoot over to the Indiana shore as
soon as it gets daylight and see what we can do
there.”</p>

<p>The suggested plan was carried out so far as
entering the mouth of Wolf Creek was concerned.
The first thing the boys did, however, was not to
search the few stores the village boasted for gasoline.
In the first place, they did not care to awaken
the store keepers, as there was no necessity for their
going on that night. In the second place, they
desired to keep their arrival at the landing as quiet as
possible, as some rumor of the show of arms at the
landing above might have filtered down the river,
in which case they would all be regarded with
suspicion.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat was fairly at rest in the mouth
of the creek, Alex opened the cabin door and
announced in a joyous voice that dinner was served
“in the dining-car.”</p>

<p>For the next hour the boys paid little attention
to anything save the bountiful meal provided by
their chum. Alex’s soda biscuit and hot apple pie
proved very attractive to the hungry boys.</p>

<p>“Now then,” Alex declared, walking out on
deck after leaving the table, “I’m going to bed for
the night!”</p>

<p>“You’ve surely earned a little sleep!” Case
grinned. “That’s the best dinner we’ve had in
many a day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I can go some when it comes to
cooking,” laughed Alex, “and I’ll wake up in shape
to cook another good breakfast in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be thinking all night what we’re going to
have for breakfast,” Clay suggested. “How did
you ever come to think of that hot apple pie?”</p>

<p>Before Alex could answer the question, Jule
caught him by the shoulder and pointed out to the
surface of the river almost directly opposite the
mouth of the creek.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“About what?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>The three blue lights!” answered Jule.</p>

<p>The other boys were all attention now, but all
declared that they could see no lights whatever.
Presently Jule bounded to the top of the gunwale,
steadying himself by the roof of the cabin, and looked
toward the distant Indiana shore.</p>

<p>“There they are!” he shouted, “There they are!
Three blue lights! Now what do you suppose they
mean?”</p>

<p>“They’re probably in a boat?” Clay asked,
tentatively.</p>

<p>“Nix on the boat!” Jule protested. “They’re
just floating right down flat on top of the wet
water.”</p>

<p>Clay now vaulted to the gunwale and followed the
direction of the boy’s pointing finger. As he
did so, a sharp detonation came from the river,
echoing down the stream weirdly, and then the
lights he had seen only a moment before
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>That was the boys’ first experience with the three
blue lights!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chX'>CHAPTER X.—ANNIVERSARY OF A WRECK.</h2>

<p class='first'>There was a blank look on Clay’s face as he
stepped back to the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>. Jule also
showed great excitement as he faced his friend.</p>

<p>“Did you see them?” the latter asked of Clay.</p>

<p>“See what?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“The three blue lights!” Jule answered.</p>

<p>Alex and Case punched each other in the ribs
and chuckled.</p>

<p>“You’re the boy that’s been reading out of the
dream book,” the latter said.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see three blue lights right down on
the surface of the river?” asked Jule, again
turning to Clay.</p>

<p>“I certainly did!” the latter answered.</p>

<p>“Then they’re there yet,” Alex insisted, vaulting
to the top of the gunwale. “They must be
there yet, for no boat could disappear so quickly.
I’ll take a look at them myself.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you they wasn’t in any boat!” insisted
Jule. “They were floating right on the surface of
the water—three large and very brilliant blue
lights.”</p>

<p>“Did you see them, Clay?” asked Alex, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Clay, “I did, and they were actually
floating directly on the surface of the river.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I see them, then?” demanded Alex
from his position on the gunwale.</p>

<p>“Because,” laughed Jule, “it is only the eye of
the believer that sees. Clay believed, and he saw.”</p>

<p>“Honest, Clay?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw three blue lights down to the level
of the river,” answered Clay, “and I saw something
more. You-all heard the explosion?” he
asked. “Well, when that explosion came, there was
a puff of smoke and the lights went out in a second.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there any one in sight?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“No one in sight!” replied Clay.</p>

<p>“No boat, or anything of that kind?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing!” shouted Jule. “I tell you those
three blue lights came right up out of the bed of the
river. And then there was an explosion, and they
disappeared, just like they’d been winked out.
Strangest thing I ever saw!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s enough for me!” Alex declared.
“You’ll be seeing green elephants with blue tails
next. I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>In a short time all the boys were abed save Jule,
who sat on the prow with Captain Joe and Teddy,
the bear. The night had not fulfilled its promise of
rain, and the stars now shone dimly down from a
misty sky. It was very still on the <i>Rambler</i>’s deck,
for no noises came from the landing, and there was
no wash of the current against the boat.</p>

<p>The boy was puzzling over the strange appearance
and disappearance of the three blue lights.
There was a trace of superstition in the nature of
the boy, and he was half inclined to regard what
had been seen as a manifestation of the supernatural.</p>

<p>“If Clay hadn’t seen the same thing I did,” he
mused, “I wouldn’t have any trouble making up my
mind. Blue lights don’t rise up out of rivers through
human agency.”</p>

<p>The boys were all astir shortly after daybreak,
and Alex went on a scouting tour up to the little
river settlement at the mouth of Wolf Creek. The
<i>Rambler</i> lay only a few feet from a rough pier
which had been spiled out into the stream, so the
boys had no difficulty in reaching the shore. The
rowboat, it will be remembered, had been left up
the river when the two boys had set out on their
hunting trip.</p>

<p>Early as it was, the boy found people moving
about the one street of the little town, which lay on
the east bank of the creek bearing its own name.
Standing on the rude platform before a small storehouse,
the boy saw two men; one of sober aspect,
wearing a long gray beard, and the other much
younger and showing a laughing face under his
dilapidated cap. As he approached the younger
man beckoned.</p>

<p>“What do you want, boy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Gasoline,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The young fellow stepped off the platform and
advanced toward the pier where the <i>Rambler</i> lay.
The old man sat down on the platform.</p>

<p>“Is that your boat?” the young man asked of
Alex.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s our boat,” replied the boy. “Our
gasoline tanks are empty. Can I buy a supply in
town, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” was the answer. “Father keeps it
for sale. During the course of the season a good
many motor boats tie up here. We keep all manner
of supplies.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” Alex replied, “We’d like to get
about a dozen spark plugs. I don’t think that
porcelain insulation is as good as it used to be, for we
break a good many. They go smash at the least
little jar.”</p>

<p>“All right!” the young man replied. “Step up
there and tell father what you want and he’ll open
the store now. Are your friends on the boat
awake?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Alex. “They’re all awake
except the bear and the bulldog.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed and turned toward the
pier, while Alex hastened toward the place where
the old gentleman sat on the store platform.</p>

<p>The boy explained his wants briefly and the old
gentleman unlocked the battered door of his place
of business. It was an uncouth, unpainted, sidling
little store, with broken panes showing in the
windows and new shingles speckling the roof.</p>

<p>The interior, however, showed considerable care
in the arrangement of goods and the stock seemed
to be large and of good quality. Without making
any pretense of waiting on the boy, the old dealer,
who introduced himself as Martin Groger, seated
himself in a much whittled arm chair and pointed
Alex to another.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he said with a very serious expression
of countenance, “did you sleep in the motor boat
at the mouth of Wolf Creek last night?”</p>

<p>“Part of the night,” answered Alex.</p>

<p>“What did you hear along after midnight, say
an hour or two after midnight?”</p>

<p>“Nothing special,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything that sounded like an
explosion?” the old man went on, “—something like
the explosion of a boiler?”</p>

<p>“Why, I heard something of that kind,” Alex
replied, wondering what the old gentleman was
getting at. “Did you hear that, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard it,” answered the old gentleman,
drawing his long beard through his fingers and
fixing his grave eyes on those of the lad. “Yes, I
heard it,” he repeated, “and I’ve heard it a good
many nights when there wasn’t any one else awake
to hear it—when there wasn’t any one else astir in
the village but me, and no boat tied up at the mouth
of Wolf Creek. Did you see anything?” he added
eagerly.</p>

<p>“What would you expect me to see?” asked
Alex, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I ain’t saying anything about that,” replied the
old gentleman. “I’m asking you a plain simple
question. Did you see anything just before that
explosion?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” the boy answered, “but two of
my chums did.”</p>

<p>The merchant leaned forward with suspicion in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“You’re not lying about this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I would have no object in doing that.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me what you saw.”</p>

<p>“Two of my chums saw three blue lights floating
on the surface of the river—at least that’s what
they said.”</p>

<p>“And this was just before the explosion?”
queried the old man.</p>

<p>“The lights disappeared after the explosion,”
Alex explained. “Do you know anything about
them?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Boy,” the old man exclaimed, moving about in
his chair excitedly, “your chums have seen what
only one person in this section has ever been able to
locate.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Alex declared, “any one, I guess, might
have seen the lights. The boys said they stuck out
from the river like a sore thumb.”</p>

<p>“Just so!” answered the old gentleman, eagerly.
“Just so! Now let me tell you something about
those blue lights,” he went on. “I’ve seen them
time and time again, but the people hereabouts
always deny seeing them.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that remarkable?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“There’s my son Charles, now,” continued the
old man. “I’ve tried to point them out to him, but
he says they don’t exist. Flings out at his old
father just like that. Says they don’t exist!”</p>

<p>“How often do they appear?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard of their being about before
last night for several months,” answered the old
merchant. “I was in hopes they’d never be seen
here again.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with ’em?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” was the reply. “They bring
disaster!”</p>

<p>“Alex restrained a burst of laughter with difficulty,
but finally managed to face the old gentleman gravely.</p>

<p>“Bring disaster, do they?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Indeed they do!” was the reply. “Whenever
the ghosts of the river dead walk on the surface of
the water, it means trouble for all river dwellers.”</p>

<p>“Many years ago,” the old man continued, “the
<i>Mary Ann</i>, as trim a passenger packet as ever
sailed between Cincinnati and the Mississippi, blew
her boilers all to flinders right opposite the mouth
of Wolf Creek. There were two hundred passengers
on board and they were dancing when the explosion
took place.”</p>

<p>“The deck where they were amusing themselves
was lighted by three blue lights! Ever since that
night, the three blue lights have warned of
impending calamity.”</p>

<p>“So you think they’re ghost lights, do you?”
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“I know they are!” replied the old merchant.
“And I’ll tell you why. Those lights never fail
to appear on the anniversary of the wrecking of the
boat.</p>

<p>“The Mary Ann went down ten years ago to-night,
and on every anniversary of the drowning of
those two hundred people, the three blue lights are
seen rising over the exact place where she sank.”</p>

<p>“That’s remarkable!” exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>“Those who were drowned,” the merchant continued,
“went down in their sins. They were dancing
to the devil’s music when they sank. Their
bodies rest uneasily on the bottom of the river, for
none of them were ever found.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s singular!” Alex remarked. “It
would seem that the bodies might have been
recovered.”</p>

<p>“They never have been found,” was the reply.
“River men say they were carried off by an undercurrent
and whirled down into the Mississippi, but
I believe the bodies are in there yet.”</p>

<p>“And every anniversary of their death, they show
three blue lights, do they?” asked the boy wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Three blue lights!” said the old man, “and
after the three blue lights, the explosion. I have
watched for the lights and the noise every night
for nine years and I have never failed to see and
hear.”</p>

<p>“And trouble always comes after the exhibition?”
queried the boy. “Then there is another
mystery for the crew of the <i>Rambler</i> to solve.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI.—CATCHING BIG CATFISH.</h2>

<p class='first'>On his way back to the <i>Rambler</i> after his rather
remarkable conversation with the old merchant,
Alex met Clay and the old man’s son hastening toward the store.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” Clay announced to the boy.
“They’ve just got in a big stock of gasoline, and
we’ll fill all the tanks and buy a few red cans on the
side.”</p>

<p>“And for the love of Mike,” Alex interposed,
“buy about a peck of spark plugs. And say,” he
called out as Clay mounted the little platform in
front of the place of business, “buy a couple of
fish lines that would bring a freight car out of the
water, and the right kind of hooks to go with them.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” Clay called back.</p>

<p>“Well, you just bring the hooks and lines and
I’ll show you where the idea is,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>When Alex reached the deck of the <i>Rambler</i> he
found Case and Jule busy over a great stack of
pancakes. One was spreading them thick with honey
and the other was making them more eatable by the
use of bacon gravy. Eggs were frying in the skillet
over the stove and a great pot of coffee was
simmering on the electric coils.</p>

<p>“Whew!” shouted the boy, sticking his nose into
the cabin, “you fellows smell good in here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case laughed, “and you took good care
that you didn’t help produce the fragrance which
pervades this apartment.”</p>

<p>“I got supper last night,” pleaded Alex.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Jule cut in, “it was your turn
to get breakfast this morning, too. You know
what we all agreed to when we left Chicago on the
first trip. The boy that talked slang had to cook
the meals and wash the dishes.”</p>

<p>“Aw, when did I talk slang?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“You’ve been talking slang for a week!” Case
declared.</p>

<p>“What’d I say?” demanded Alex, scornfully.</p>

<p>“You said one of those river pirates was balmy
in the head,” answered Jule. “You’re always
making some break like that. If I had a twirler like
that you carry around with you, and couldn’t keep
it under any better control than you do yours, I’d
throw the belt off the wheels.”</p>

<p>“I know who’ll cook meals and wash dishes
now,” laughed Alex. “When it comes to talking
slang, you’ve got me backed up on a blind siding
with my fires drawn.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, boys!” roared Case. “Go to it. Get
it all off your chests, and I won’t have to do any
work for a month.”</p>

<p>Alex was soon busy at the breakfast table, and
when Clay returned with a great load of gasoline
and provisions from the store, everything was neatly
cleared away in the little cabin.</p>

<p>“There!” Clay said, throwing a great package
at Alex’s, head, “there’s your fish line and your
fish hooks, and for fear you’d want to use the coal
stove or one of the motors for a sinker, I brought
along a section of railroad iron. I guess that’ll hold
your line.”</p>

<p>As the boy spoke, he threw about four inches of
steel railway iron down on the deck with a great
thud.</p>

<p>“What did that old gentleman at the store say
to you about the three blue lights?” asked Alex,
as Clay prepared to get the boat under way. “Did
he have a ghost story to spin?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say a word to me about the three
blue lights,” Clay replied. “We didn’t have any
time to talk about such things, and we haven’t any
time now, so you fellows just get up here and help
fill these tanks.”</p>

<p>All four boys were busy in a moment and young
Groger from the store assisted materially in getting
the gasoline on board.</p>

<p>In less than an hour all was ready for departure.
The young merchant shook the boys heartily by the
hand and asked them to call if they returned
home by way of the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll come back all right,” Alex called out.
“At least, I’m coming back. I’m bound to know
something more about those three blue lights. I’m
the original mystery investigator!”</p>

<p>“So father told you about that, did he?” queried
young Groger.</p>

<p>“Of course, he did!” Alex replied. “He
couldn’t talk about anything else. He seemed to be
glad that Clay and Jule saw the three blue lights.
I guess he’s got an idea that the people around here
think he’s been talking about something that never
existed.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he is,” replied the young man.
“He’s always talking about the three blue lights
and the wreck of the <i>Mary Ann</i>, and the explosion,
and all that, but he’s the only one about here who
ever saw the lights or heard the explosion.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re mistaken there!” replied Alex.
“Clay saw them last night and Jule saw them, and
all four of us heard the explosion.”</p>

<p>Watching the young man’s face closely as he
stepped ashore, Clay thought that he saw a sudden
pallor come over it. The son was evidently as
fully superstitious as his father.</p>

<p>“Now, what did the old merchant tell you about
the three blue lights?” demanded Jule, as the boat
swung off down the river.</p>

<p>In as few words as possible Alex explained the
mystery of the three blue lights according to the
aged merchant’s theory.</p>

<p>“Well,” Jule said, after a moment’s thought,
“the three blue lights did bob up out of the river.
There wasn’t anything there to keep them floating
down with the current, or to sustain them on the
surface. And,” he went on, “there wasn’t
anything there to cause an explosion.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” Alex scorned. “You’ll be saying next,
that you believe in the ghost story! Now, just to
show you that there’s nothing to it,” he continued,
“I move that we come back up the river after a
time and find out where those blue lights come from,
and where they go to.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to that, Clay?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“You needn’t ask me whether I’m interested or
not,” Clay replied. “I’ve been thinking about those
three blue lights a whole lot. I don’t believe in
ghosts, or superstitions of any kind, but I do believe
that there is something significant about those
lights.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s settled that we’ll return and
investigate?” Alex asked.</p>

<p>The boys all replied in the affirmative and then
Alex opened the package Clay had brought him and
unrolled his fish lines, which looked more like cables
than anything else. Case and Jule laughed until
they found it necessary to hold their sides.</p>

<p>Clay looked on with an amused expression on his
face. He knew that Alex usually had a pretty good
reason for anything he did, and was expecting
something novel and original. He was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Paying no attention whatever to the jeers of his
chums, Alex bent the great hooks to the cable-like
line, took a turn with each around the section of
railroad iron, and moved the whole contraption to
the stern.</p>

<p>“Now, you fellows help me to get these lines in
right,” he commanded. “It wants one boy to a line
so they won’t get tangled when I dump this sinker
in. Hurry up now, we want this fish.”</p>

<p>“Sinker?” repeated Jule. “I thought your idea
was to build a submarine railroad.”</p>

<p>“Fish!” laughed Case. “What kind of fish do
you expect to catch with that layout? That won’t
catch fish!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” answered Alex. “If I had a book containing
all you boys don’t know about catching fish,
I’d have to rent the Coliseum in Chicago to put it
in. You boys mean well, but you’re ignorant.”</p>

<p>“Where’re you going to put this fish after you
get it?” demanded Jule, snickering. “We haven’t
got any contract for feeding any state troops, have
we? What do you want a big fish for, anyway?”</p>

<p>Alex merely thrust his hands inside the waist
band of his trousers and grinned.</p>

<p>“I’ve got plenty of storage room,” he finally declared.</p>

<p>“Honest, now, Alex,” Clay asked, “what kind
of a fish do you expect to catch?”</p>

<p>“Catfish!” was the short reply.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Jule. “I wouldn’t eat a
catfish any quicker than I would eat a cat.”</p>

<p>“What are you putting all that weight on the
lines for?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“It’ll sink the hooks into the mud about a foot,”
Jule put in.</p>

<p>“Sure it will!” continued Case. “And catfish
are never found at the bottom of the river. They
call them catfish because they climb up on things.”</p>

<p>“You’re the wise little fisher boy,” laughed Alex.
“A catfish couldn’t climb to the surface of the river
if they had an electric elevator. They live in the
mud and eat in the mud. After they get a square
meal, they stretch out on a bed of silt like a cat on
a sitting room floor. Now get these lines over and
I’ll show you what a real catfish looks like.”</p>

<p>The boys took the lines into their hands and
leaned over the stern. Alex with the iron poised
in air stopped suddenly and laid it down on deck.</p>

<p>“I guess I need a little instruction myself,” he
said. “You can’t catch catfish by trolling for them.
You’ve got to let the line lay wiggling from a weight
in the mud of the river.”</p>

<p>The boy rushed back to the motors, shut off the
power, and then dropped the anchor.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” he said, “if you’ll all get back
into the cabin and remain quiet, I’ll coax a catfish
two feet long out of the river.”</p>

<p>“You have my sympathy,” Case answered, “and
I’ll help you all I can. I’ll go back into the cabin
and make a noise like a dish of cream.”</p>

<p>Regarding Case’s offer as light and trifling, Alex
got his lines into the water and sat down to await
results.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said after a while, “but I
ought to have waited until we came under that
wooded island just ahead. Catfish have a way of
hovering in the mud around the towheads.”</p>

<p>“We can drop down if you think best,” Clay
proposed.</p>

<p>“Just you wait a minute!” Alex exclaimed all
excitement, “I’ve got a bite right now. Two
bites!” he yelled the next moment. “Both lines are
running out! Catch one, quick!”</p>

<p>The boy’s announcement that the lines were
moving out brought his three chums instantly to the
front. Case and Jule both grabbed for the same
line, with the result that the tops of their heads
came together with a thud and the line continued to
wiggle along the deck. Clay stepped on the
moving line and Alex seized it.</p>

<p>The boy now held a line in each hand and was
drawn tightly against the after gunwale.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Alex, hold on!” shouted Case.</p>

<p>“Pull ’em in, pull ’em in!” yelled Jule.</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll hold on!” panted Alex. “Why
don’t you boys catch on to the line?”</p>

<p>The boy sprang for the lines again, but their
fingers met only the bare deck. Alex, hanging on
like grim death, stood for a moment with his feet
braced against the gunwale and then went head-first
into the river.</p>

<p>“Great spoons!” Jule exclaimed. “Talk about
catfish! I’ll bet he’s got a team of wild colts at the
end of those lines!”</p>

<p>Alex, hanging to the lines, went bobbing down
the stream.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII.—THE GHOST OF THE MARY ANN.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Don’t loose your fish!” jeered Jule, leaning
over the gunwale, his face red with laughter.</p>

<p>“What do you think you are?” called Case. “A
blooming pilot?”</p>

<p>Alex could make no headway swimming in the
direction of the boat, for the creatures he had
hooked were pulling him, iron and all, toward the
Indiana shore. Now and then the boy was drawn
beneath the surface and came up spluttering, but
still grimly holding to the lines.</p>

<p>“Why don’t the little idiot let go?” asked Jule
as the boy’s head disappeared under water for the
third or fourth time.</p>

<p>“He’ll never let go!” Case exclaimed. “Why
don’t we get the <i>Rambler</i> under motion and pick
him up?”</p>

<p>The motor boat was soon racing toward the boy.
Alex was still hanging to his fish lines, and the
catfish, or whatever was at the other end, were
making fast for the center of the stream.</p>

<p>It took some moments to reach the boy, and more
time to land him on deck, for he still persisted in
hanging on to the fish lines.</p>

<p>Not until the thick lines were securely fastened
to a deck cleat would the boy release his hold.</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay laughed, “if anybody can find a
derrick, we’ll get these fish on board.”</p>

<p>“Aw, those are not fish,” Jule exclaimed, “they’re
alligators!”</p>

<p>“Whatever they are,” Alex grinned, “I didn’t
let ’em get away with me! They ducked me, but
they didn’t get away!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay said in a moment, observing that
the lines had ceased to move about in the water,
“your fish must be pretty well tired out by this time,
so we’ll take them ashore.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Alex replied. “While you’re towing
them to a shallow place, I’ll go and get on some
dry clothes.”</p>

<p>When at last the motor boat drew the hooks and
the sinker to a shallow spot on the Kentucky side,
the boys saw two monstrous catfish squirming
weakly. In grabbing for the raw beef with which
the hooks had been baited, they had been caught
far back in the jaws, so no amount of pulling could
have released them.</p>

<p>“They’re alive yet!” shouted Jule.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix that in a minute!” Alex declared,
appearing on deck in a dry suit. “I’ll administer a
couple of lead pills which will cure the ills of life.”</p>

<p>“Hear him talk Shakespeare!” jeered Jule.</p>

<p>Alex considered this remark too immaterial to
notice. He leveled his automatic at the fish and
fired a volley at their heads.</p>

<p>“Now, where’s that derrick?” asked Case.</p>

<p>As the fish were nearly two yards in length, it
was evident that only one need be brought aboard
for food, so one was sent sailing down the stream
and the other was, with no little difficulty, lifted to
the deck. Alex danced about his prize joyously.</p>

<p>“Why, look here!” Case exclaimed. “This
fish hasn’t got any scales!”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’ve been going through all this
to get a sturgeon?” asked Alex. “I should think
not!”</p>

<p>“The catfish,” Clay explained, “belongs to the
bullhead tribe, and has a hard, tough hide instead
of scales.”</p>

<p>“Is it good to eat?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s good to eat,” answered Alex.
“Do you think I’d go to the floor of the river with
a fish that wasn’t fit to eat?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know why they call these things catfish,”
Case exclaimed, turning the monster with his
foot.</p>

<p>“Huh!” snickered Jule. “They have back
fences at the bottom of the river, and these fish
climb up and give midnight concerts.”</p>

<p>“Jule,” said Alex gravely, “your imagination
seems to be getting the best of your conscience. If
we had an Ananias club on board this boat, you
surely would be the Perpetual Grand.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jule said, “when you get a club
formed I’ll take the office. But who’s going to cook
this fish?” he went on.</p>

<p>“I’ll cook him if you’ll skin him,” Case offered.
“We want only a few pounds of catfish steak,”
Clay observed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to boil about half of him!” Alex
declared, “so as to give Captain Joe and Teddy the
feast of their lives.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder Captain Joe didn’t jump into the
river after you when the fish invited you down into
the mud,” Jule laughed.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe and the bear were both asleep in
the cabin,” Case explained.</p>

<p>The boys had a merry time preparing that fish
for cooking. It is not hard work to dress a catfish
if you know how, but these boys did not know
how. At last, however, a great hunk was boiling
in a pot and slices were ready for frying. By noon
the meal was ready, and the boys all admitted that
Alex’s, catfish was a very good substitute for
salmon, although nothing at all like it in appearance.</p>

<p>The boys drifted slowly on the river that day,
taking in the wild scenery and stopping now and
then at cosy little landings on the Kentucky side.
It was a warm, clear day in September, and the
world never looked brighter to them than it did at
that time.</p>

<p>They passed river craft of all shapes and sizes
during the day. There were monstrous steamers
having the appearance of floating hotels, there
were great freight boats loaded to the guards, there
were house-boats, motor boats, and great coal tows
which dominated the stream as they passed.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat,” Clay said just before twilight,
“which looks to me like a river saloon and I
think those on board are watching the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“If it is,” Case suggested, “we’d better take to
our heels. We don’t want any more experience
with river pirates.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” broke in Alex. “Those
fellows don’t own the river. We’ve got just as much
right here as they have. If they try to come aboard,
we’ll set Teddy on them.”</p>

<p>The suspicious steamer checked her speed as the
boys slowed down on the <i>Rambler</i>, and it was soon
evident that those in charge of the whiskey boat
were desirous of speaking with the boys.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” called a voice from the cabin
deck of the steamer.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself!” Alex called back.</p>

<p>“How’s the bear?” asked the voice.</p>

<p>“Fine!” Alex answered.</p>

<p>“What do you know about our bear?” Case demanded.</p>

<p>“I was on the <i>Hawk</i> last night,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did you see those two men head for the
water?” Jule asked with a snicker.</p>

<p>“Funniest thing I ever saw!” the other answered.</p>

<p>There was a short silence and then another voice
called out from the steamer:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you boys come on board?”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” answered Clay.</p>

<p>“Some of our people want a look at the dog and
bear!” the first speaker said. “So, if you don’t
object, we’ll come on board.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” Clay answered.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that!” came from the boat.</p>

<p>The steamer shot ahead so as to come up to the
port side of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Keep off!” ordered Clay. “We don’t want any
of that whiskey crowd on board! If you try to put
foot on our deck, we’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” laughed the other.</p>

<p>While Clay had been talking with those on board
the steamer, Case had been at work with the motors,
and the <i>Rambler</i> now shot ahead at full speed,
drawing swiftly away from the steamer.</p>

<p>There was an instant commotion on the deck of
the saloon boat and then she, too, shot ahead at a
good rate of speed.</p>

<p>Given a clear stretch of water, the <i>Rambler</i> would
soon have been out of sight of the steamer, but on
turning a bend, a monster coal tow came into view.
There were rows on rows of barges heaped high
with coal, all headed for the Mississippi. In the rear
was a gamey tug swinging from side to side in
order to keep the fleet under control.</p>

<p>“Now we are up against it!” exclaimed Clay.
“We never can get by those barges!”</p>

<p>“How do the steamers get by?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“They don’t get by at all when the coal tow is
passing around a narrow bend like that!” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do?” Alex asked.
“Let those fellows come on board here and eat us
up?”</p>

<p>“If there weren’t so many people on board that
saloon boat,” Case declared, “I’d dynamite it.
She ought to be blown out of the water, anyway.
We can’t be bothered all the way down with these
whiskey boats!”</p>

<p>“We shall be if we don’t make a record in some
way!” Clay said. “I move we run into the little
creek there on the Indiana shore and shoot if they
come near us.”</p>

<p>“Say!” Alex said in a moment. “That isn’t a
creek at all. Don’t you see that the main river is
on the other side of it? That’s a big island with a
lagoon in the middle, and an opening on the upper
end.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the main river on the other side!”
Case observed. “It is wide, but it looks shallow.
If it was the main river, we could pass through
there and so get in ahead of the coal tow.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, suppose we run into the lagoon,”
suggested Alex.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and the lights of the
saloon boat showed that those on board were holding
some sort of conference with those on board the
tug in charge of the tow. The boats were some
distance apart, yet even in the gathering darkness
the boys could see the crew of the barges racing
over the coal in order to do business with the
bartender on the steamer.</p>

<p>“Before morning,” Case observed, “those saloon
pirates will have every dollar there is in that bunch
of rivermen. I wish there was some way to
separate the two crews.</p>

<p>“What do we care?” laughed Alex. “Either
bunch would rob us if they could.”</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay said in a moment, “turn the boat
in toward the entrance to the lagoon, keep all the
lights off, and let her drift. They’ll think we’ve
gone downstream on the other side of the island.”</p>

<p>“That lagoon looks pretty good to me,” Jule
observed. “I feel like I hadn’t had any sleep for a
week. We’ll just tie right up in that little pond and
sleep all we want to.”</p>

<p>“That will be a nice place to tie up!” laughed
Case. “Alex won’t run any risk of being towed
down the Mississippi if he goes fishing again.”</p>

<p>And so, with no lights showing, the <i>Rambler</i>,
under the impetus of the last push of the propeller,
glided noiselessly into the mouth of the lagoon.
Both arms of the island were heavily wooded and
in a moment, the boys were out of sight of the tow
and the saloon boat. It was dark and still along
both shores of the lagoon. Wild birds settling for
the night called to each other across the narrow
stretch of water, but otherwise all was silent.</p>

<p>“Nice and quiet,” Jule declared, “but just look
ahead there, if you will. You can all see the three
blue lights, now, if you want to! The ghost of the
<i>Mary Ann</i> must have lost his bearings.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII.—EXPLORING A LAGOON.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Are those blue lights on the water or on the
shore?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“You can search me!” Alex replied.</p>

<p>“They’re on the water!” insisted Jule. “Can’t
you see the blue gleam shining on the waves?”</p>

<p>“Wherever they are,” Clay said, “I’m going
down and investigate.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Alex. “We’ll go
down and see what the ghost of the <i>Mary Ann</i> has
to say for himself.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of taking Captain Joe for company,”
Clay laughed.</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex grinned, “go on with Captain
Joe if you want to.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid two will make too much noise making
their way through the thickets,” Clay said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“How are you going to get ashore?” asked
Alex, briefly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to pole the <i>Rambler</i> up close enough
so I can jump,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I guess you can do that all right,” Case cut in.
“This water seems to me to be about fifty feet
deep.”</p>

<p>“This is an odd looking island,” Jule observed.
“The land seems to be shaped like a horse shoe.”</p>

<p>“There are numerous odd-shaped islands in the
Mississippi and Ohio rivers. You can see easily
enough how this peculiar formation came about,”
Clay observed, “some forest fire burned the timber
out of the center of the island. When the roots and
stumps died out, the river carried the soil away. If
the big trees on the two arms of the island should
be cut down, the river would eat the soil away in a
very short time.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do when you get
over to shore?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“I’m going to sneak down to where the lights
show, and see what it is that makes them.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex said with an aggrieved air,
“while you’re out having fun with the blue lights
and the dog I’ll go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come along if you want to,” Clay laughed.</p>

<p>“No,” Alex replied more cheerfully, “I think
I’ll go to bed. You boys can blunder around all
night if you want to.”</p>

<p>The boy made his way to the cabin, and Clay
warped the boat toward the north shore. In a few
moments the keel seemed to strike bottom and then
the boy examined the bank with a searchlight. All
was clear so he sprang lightly across the narrow
stretch of water and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>The three blue lights were still observable not far
from two hundred yards from the boat. They lay
in a straight line up and down the lagoon.</p>

<p>The boys heard Clay making his way through
the thicket for a few moments, and then all sounds
on the shore ceased.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’ll find anything in there,”
Jule said.</p>

<p>“Then what makes those lights?” demanded
Case.</p>

<p>“The old merchant up at Wolf Creek told us
what made the three blue lights,” chuckled Jule.</p>

<p>“I just believe,” Case replied, “that that is some
signal.”</p>

<p>“What would be the use of a signal, out in the
middle of the river opposite Wolf Creek?”
demanded Jule.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain it,” Case answered, “but it’s a
signal, just the same. It just can’t be anything
else.”</p>

<p>“And what would be the use of a signal in this
little old shut-in lagoon?” continued Jule.</p>

<p>“Then if it isn’t a signal, what is it?” asked
Case.</p>

<p>“It’s just some natural phenomenon,” was the
reply. “When Clay gets down there he won’t see
anything at all. It may be that you can’t see the
lights from any direction except this! You’ve seen
wandering lights in swamps, haven’t you? Well,
it’s my idea that this is that kind of a light.”</p>

<p>“We may know something more about it when
Clay comes back,” Case suggested. “He may find
out what it means.”</p>

<p>While the boys sat on the deck watching the
mysterious lights with puzzled eyes, there came a
quick, sharp explosion and the lights disappeared.
The explosion sounded like the touching off of
dynamite.</p>

<p>Both boys arose to their feet and leaned over the
gunwale of the boat, gazing down the lagoon with
mystified faces.</p>

<p>“Alex went to bed too early!” Case suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, he should have seen that little old Fourth
of July celebration,” Jule replied. “Let’s wake him
up and tell him about it.”</p>

<p>“You wake him up,” Case answered.</p>

<p>Jule made his way into the cabin and felt around
on the bunk occupied by the boy. Teddy, the bear
cub, lay there sound asleep but Alex had disappeared!
Jule returned to the deck with a grin.</p>

<p>“That little idiot,” he said, “has left the boat
again.”</p>

<p>“We might have known he would!” answered
Case. “He runs away from the boat in the night
every time he gets a chance, especially if Clay is
ashore. They’ll both be back here before long.”</p>

<p>“Clay probably will,” Jule observed, “but we
don’t know when Alex will return. We usually
have to get him out of some scrape.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Clay was pushing steadily
through the thicket which lined the north arm of
the peculiar-shaped island. For some moments he
guided his steps by the blue lights which seemed
to him to rest upon the water. Then came the
explosion which the boys had heard and the lights
were no longer in view.</p>

<p>“Now that’s a funny proposition,” the boy
mused. “Why should those lights be hidden in
this out of the way lagoon, and why should they
pop out like that?”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, following close at the boy’s heels,
now forced his way through the underbrush to the
water’s edge and began uttering a series of low
growls. Clay whistled softly but the dog refused
to return. In a moment he ceased his verbal
demonstrations and lay still, looking across the lagoon
to the other shore.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Captain Joe?”
Clay demanded in a whisper. “If you see some one
who might have produced those lights, why don’t
you say so? And don’t make so much noise about
it, either!”</p>

<p>The dog advanced a few feet into the water until
his shoulders were well covered and then backed
out again. All this time his snarling muzzle was
directed toward the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Directly he came out of the lagoon and crouched
down at Clay’s feet.</p>

<p>“There’s something going on here, dog,” Clay
whispered, patting Captain Joe on the head, “and
we’ll just settle down right here and find out what
it is. All you’ve got to do in order to help out is to
keep still.”</p>

<p>The dog nodded his head knowingly, and the two
crouched down in the darkness of the thicket to
listen and to watch.</p>

<p>While they waited, the lights of the <i>Rambler</i>
showed farther up, and Clay understood that
something unusual was in progress there.</p>

<p>“They might as well invite that saloon boat to
come sailing in here as to turn on those lights!”
Clay muttered. “There must be something serious
or they never would illuminate the <i>Rambler</i> in that
way.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe now began moving restlessly about,
and finally started up the lagoon toward the motor
boat. Clay followed slowly, and soon came within
the circle of light from the deck. He found Case
and Jule looking over the gunwale.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you put out the lights?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We turned them on to direct you boys home,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“You boys home?” repeated Clay.</p>

<p>“Yes, you boys!” answered Jule. “Alex
jumped out about as soon as you left. Did you
see him anywhere?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he came out on this side” Clay
replied.</p>

<p>“If he didn’t,” Jule went on, “he’s in some mixup
over on the south arm. There’s doings of some
kind over there.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Because, just a few moments after we discovered
that the boy had gone, a large rowboat
came in at the mouth of the lagoon, passed along
our port side and ducked into the bank some distance
down. We couldn’t see her, of course, only
just for a second as she came opposite us, and then
only indistinctly, but we could hear her when she
landed.”</p>

<p>“The question before the house now,” Case observed,
“is about getting you on board again.
You can jump from the gunwale to the shore but
you can’t jump from the shore back to the gunwale.”</p>

<p>“There’s a long board under the forward deck
between the storage bins,” Clay answered. “Get
that out and I’ll climb it.”</p>

<p>The board was brought, and Clay was soon on
deck. The first thing he did was to turn off the
lights.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?” asked Case.
“Alex never will find his way back here in the
darkness!”</p>

<p>“Alex can hide in some thicket until we find out
what’s going on,” Clay answered. “As for the
<i>Rambler</i>, we want to drift down so those in the boat
won’t know exactly where she lies.”</p>

<p>The boat drifted down on the sluggish current
of the lagoon for perhaps two hundred yards, and
then the anchor was dropped at a point very near
to where the three blue lights had shown.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll keep as quiet as three bugs in a rug
till we find out what’s going on,” Clay said.</p>

<p>“What did you find out about the lights?” asked
Jule.</p>

<p>“They went out before I got to them,” Clay
answered.</p>

<p>“What do you think about them?” Jule insisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t think!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Case insists that they are merely signals,” Jule
went on.</p>

<p>“That’s my idea, too,” Clay answered. “The
lights certainly do not come up out of the water.”</p>

<p>“But who would be signaling in this lonely old
lagoon?” demanded Jule.</p>

<p>“That’s what we don’t know,” Clay returned.
“All we’ve got to do is to lie here and watch.”</p>

<p>“Say!” Case exclaimed in a moment. “What
did you do with Captain Joe?”</p>

<p>“Why, he was right there when I came on
board,” Clay replied. “I thought he came up the
long plank right after me.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t?” Case went on. “I took in
the board after you came up, and the dog was
nowhere in sight.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that!” answered Clay. “I certainly
am glad of that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any good reason for celebrating the
disappearance of the dog!” growled Case.</p>

<p>“I do!” Jule cut in. “Captain Joe will go and
find Alex.”</p>

<p>“Sure he will!” admitted Case. “I never
thought of that.”</p>

<p>The three boys sat for a long time on the deck of
the motor boat looking out into the darkness. Now
and then they heard the sound of rustling bushes
on the shores, but as a rule the scene was very still.
It must have been near midnight when Jule
caught his chums by their arms and drew them
closer to the port gunwale.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, nodding his head to the west,
“there are the three blue lights. They are close to
the south arm of the island this time. Now what
do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“Let’s wait and see if they blow up like the
others did,” suggested Case. “They, too, may
explode with a loud noise.”</p>

<p>“What else can we do?” chuckled Jule.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing we can do,” Clay
advised, “if we want to settle this mystery right here
and now, and that is to turn on the motors and shoot
down there like a rocket.”</p>

<p>“I’m for it!” Jule declared. “Let’s ram the ghost
out of the water!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV.—CAPTAIN JOE HELPS SOME.</h2>

<p class='first'>Alex did not remain long in the cabin of the
<i>Rambler</i> after Clay’s departure. His two chums
were seated on the prow of the boat, and the lights
were out, so he had little difficulty in dropping
unobserved into the water. Before leaving the cabin,
he had drawn on an old suit of clothes used for just
such purposes, so he did not mind getting wet.</p>

<p>Once in the water, he struck out for the south
arm of the island. It was his idea that the coal
tow and the saloon boat would hover about that
spot for some little time. Those who had whiskey
to sell would be sure to keep in the company of
the tow, and those who had the whiskey thirst
would be pretty apt to rush on board the steamer
for the purpose of satisfying it.</p>

<p>The boy, of course, did not understand that the
tug in charge of the barges could not have held
them against the push of the current in any event.
His idea that the tow and the saloon boat would
keep company, however, was the correct one.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as his feet came in contact with
the sloping shore of the south arm, he heard shouts
of laughter coming across the wooded stretch of
land between the lagoon and the main channel of
the river. Proceeding on as rapidly as was
possible in the darkness, he soon came to a position
from which he could see the lights of the steamer.
She was standing perfectly still some distance down
the stream from the mouth of the lagoon, and the
tug and barges seemed to have halted, too.</p>

<p>Directly he saw lights flashing along the barges
and heard exclamations of anger and dismay from
the front ranks. Then he saw what had taken
place. The crew of the tow had paid too much
attention to whiskey and too little to navigation.</p>

<p>The front line had grounded at a bend just
below, and the others were piling against them. Even
with his limited knowledge of river work, the boy
saw that it would be hours before the barges could
be towed off the bar. A good many of the men
supposed to be in charge of the tow were still
drinking on board the saloon boat.</p>

<p>“That’s always the way with whiskey,” Alex
said. “It jumps into the places where it can make
the most trouble. “If I ever take a drink of the
stuff, I hope I’ll get five years for every drop I
swallow. A person who drinks whiskey is no
good, anyway, and might as well be in prison as
anywhere else.”</p>

<p>There was now a great commotion on board the
steamer, and the boy saw that those in charge of
the tow were forcing their unruly employes back
to their duty. Directly the steamer anchored a
short distance up the river. The barges which were
grounded were detached from the main tow, and
the whole mass went swinging down the river
again, followed by shouts of laughter from the
steamer.</p>

<p>“Now,” mused the boy, “I wonder whether that
pirate boat will keep on after the tow in order to
get what little money those poor fools have left,
or whether it will be kept here in the hope of
annexing the <i>Rambler</i>?”</p>

<p>The question was answered in a moment, for the
steamer edged in close to the shore and threw out
an anchor.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” Alex muttered. “Now they’ll
be running over this island to find the <i>Rambler</i>,
caught like a rat in a trap. I’m glad they haven’t
got sense enough to run up and block the lagoon!”</p>

<p>The lights of the steamer made a fair illumination
on the bank where Alex lay, and directly he
saw a boat put out and head for the very thicket
which concealed him. He crept softly back toward
the interior and waited for developments. When
the boat touched the shore two men stepped out
and pressed through the thicket toward the lagoon.</p>

<p>“This is foolishness,” the boy heard one of the
men say. “I tell you, Bostock,” he went on,
“that the motor boat made the north passage and
went on down the river while we were fooling with
that tow crowd.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it, Davis,” was the reply.
“They just doused their lights and dropped into
the lagoon. I was watching the river and no lights
showed below the island.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Davis said, “we can soon find out. It
isn’t far from here to the lagoon, though it’s mighty
unpleasant traveling in the night time. You may
be right, but I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>The two men passed within six feet of where
Alex lay, concealed, and as soon as the thicket
closed behind them, he crept along in their wake.
As the men made considerable noise themselves, he
figured that they would not be likely to hear any
racket he might make.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes the three reached the highest
point on the island, from which, in daylight, both
the main channel of the river and the lagoon might
be seen. Just at the moment they came within sight
of the inner channel the lights flared out on the
<i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>Alex restrained an exclamation of disgust with
great difficulty.</p>

<p>“The confounded idiots!” he said under his
breath. “To go and light those lamps at this time!
Why, we crawled in there to hide!”</p>

<p>“There!” the boy heard the man who had been
called Bostock exclaim, “I told you the motor boat
had made for the lagoon!”</p>

<p>“Well, you were right,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Now, all we’ve got to do,” Bostock went on,
“is to run the steamer up to the mouth of the lagoon
and nail these boys in good and tight.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” the other answered, “and once
we get hold of that motor boat there isn’t a thing
we can’t do on this river. I’ve heard of the
exploits of those boys all the way down from Pittsburg.
That boat is built with the motors of a sea-going
tug, and can outrun anything on the river.
Besides that, unless I am greatly mistaken, the
cabin and the deck under the gunwales are bullet-proof.”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” Bostock answered. “There
isn’t a thing we can’t do after we get hold of that
boat, but what are we going to do with the boys?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make some arrangements for
keeping them out of the way,” Davis suggested.
“If they put up a fight, well, the lagoon is a pretty
good place to leave them.”</p>

<p>“Now, then,” mused Alex, “the thing for me
to do is to shoot both of those murderers, and so
get the <i>Rambler</i> out of this scrape!”</p>

<p>Without any intention of following his own
advice, the boy thrust his hand into his pistol pocket
and found it empty.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he muttered, “it wouldn’t have been
any good after swimming over here. It seems as
if I never did have a gun when I wanted one.”</p>

<p>The boy struck off to the east, his idea being to
gain a position a short distance above the <i>Rambler</i>
and then swim aboard. He had proceeded but a
few yards when a rustling in the bushes just ahead
attracted his attention. The rustling was soon
followed by a low growl, and directly the damp
muzzle of the bulldog was thrust into the boy’s
face.</p>

<p>“So you’ve gone and run away, too, have you
Captain Joe?” demanded Alex. “I’ve a great
mind to send you out to eat up two pirates.”</p>

<p>It was too dark to see the bulldog distinctly, but
Alex knew that he was accepting the commission
joyfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will do any good, doggie,” the
boy finally whispered. “Those pirates are about
like skunks—you kill one and half a dozen more
come to the funeral. If those fellows don’t get
back to their steamer directly, there’ll be a mob
of their companions on this island before daylight.
All we can do now is to get to the <i>Rambler</i> and
head her out of this lagoon before the steamer gets
to the entrance.”</p>

<p>With this object in mind, the boy and dog made
their way swiftly through the thicket, paying little
attention to the noise they made. Far in the
rear they heard the river pirates calling out to them,
but paid no attention. When Alex reached the
shore of the lagoon he was at a loss which way to
turn. There was now no illumination to show the
location of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“What’s your notion now, Captain Joe?” he
asked of the dog. “If you can tell me which way
to turn to find that motor boat, I’ll give you a
chunk of catfish as big as your head when we get
aboard.”</p>

<p>Thus urged and bribed, the dog lost no time in
turning to the west.</p>

<p>“I think you’re wrong, Captain Joe!” Alex urged.</p>

<p>The bulldog insisted that he was right, and as
the boy had no good grounds upon which to dispute
his judgment, he followed along after him.
It was by no means good walking along the bank,
for in many places trees and shrubs had been
undermined during high water, and trunks and masses
of smaller growth often stretched out into the
water.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, Captain Joe,” Alex said
as they went along. “If you dare to take me back
where those saloon pirates are, I’ll advise Teddy to
take a bite out of your ear when we get aboard the
<i>Rambler</i> again, if we ever do.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe’s only reply was to seize Alex by
one trousers’ leg and hustle him along over a mass
of boughs which seemed to the boy to be several
miles high.</p>

<p>At last, after a great deal of this climbing, Joe
stopped on the bank of the lagoon and pointed with
his nose out over the water. The two of them
must have made considerable racket scrambling
along the beach, for just as Joe stopped a soft
whistle came out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe,” whispered Alex, patting the dog
on the head, “you’re the candy kid! That’s Clay,
without the shadow of a doubt. Now you tell him
that we want to come aboard.”</p>

<p>As if understanding every word spoken to him
by the lad, the dog fawned about for a moment and
then uttered a short, sharp bark.</p>

<p>“Come aboard, you runaway!” a voice whispered
from the boat.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we won’t! exclaimed Alex.
“Can’t you show a light just for a minute? It’s
so dark I wouldn’t know the river was wet if I
didn’t feel it.”</p>

<p>A flashlight was turned on for just an instant
and then shut off. Captain Joe greeted the finger
of light with a joyous bark and plunged into the
lagoon. Alex was about to follow his example in
the matter of taking to the water when he felt
himself seized by the collar and drawn back. It was
evident that the two had made altogether too much
noise, and had been followed by the men from the
steamer.</p>

<p>“Keep your mouth closed now!” whispered one
of the men in Alex’s ear.</p>

<p>“Ram your gun down his throat if he doesn’t!”
another voice said.</p>

<p>Alex knew that the purpose of the pirates was
to prevent his warning his companions of the
presence of the steamer and its crew in that vicinity.
He knew, too, that unless he could notify those on
board the <i>Rambler</i> of the intentions of the pirates,
their retreat from the lagoon would soon be shut
off.</p>

<p>He knew, too, that he was taking great chances
in making the situation understood. Still, he
decided to risk his own life in order to warn his
friends. With the pirate holding him by the
collar, he sprang forward and cried at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p>“Captain Joe! Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>Something in the tone of the boy’s voice told the
dog as well as those on board the motor boat that
Alex was in deadly peril. It was not his habit to
ask for assistance unless it was very badly needed.</p>

<p>Answering the indefinite but well-understood
appeal, the dog turned back to the shore, unseen but
plainly heard in the disturbed waters.</p>

<p>One of the men struck fiercely at his head with
the butt of a gun as he swept past him. The man
who had hold of the boy fired a shot at the dim
rushing figure. The bullet went wide of its mark.</p>

<p>The next instant the bulldog had a set of very
capable teeth clamped about the throat of the
outlaw. The man struggled and gurgled horribly as
the impact of the dog’s body threw him back,
releasing Alex from his grasp. The boy sprang
away and shouted:</p>

<p>“Turn on the lights, boys, turn on the lights!”
In a second the powerful searchlight on the prow
of the <i>Rambler</i> was turned on the spot from which
the call had proceeded. It revealed one of the men
lying helpless on the ground, writhing under the
dog’s jaws and the other disappearing in a thicket.</p>

<p>Alex picked up the outlaw’s revolver, which had
fallen to the ground, and called the dog away. He
was stooping over the prostrate figure to ascertain,
if possible, the extent of the injuries inflicted
by the dog when a shot came from a tangle a short
distance away.</p>

<p>“Come on, Captain Joe!” the boy shouted.
“Let him alone.”</p>

<p>Leaving the two outlaws on the bank, one-half
unconscious, the other raging helplessly in the
jungle, the boy and the dog sprang into the lagoon.
As they did so another harmless shot came from
the interior, and then the lights on the <i>Rambler</i>
were switched off.</p>

<p>Several spiteful shots were now fired toward the
boat, but the two swimmers were, of course, out of
sight of the outlaws, so the bullets were not
directed at them.</p>

<p>In a very brief space of time, Alex and Captain
Joe were hauled on deck, where they lay dripping
and panting for an instant before a word was
spoken. The lights were still out.</p>

<p>“You’re a beautiful pair!” Jule whispered, then.
“We were just talking about you two getting into
a scrape before we got out of the lagoon.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the scrape!” Alex panted, still
breathing hard. “Put on full power and steam up
out of the lagoon. That whiskey boat is going up
to block the way!”</p>

<p>Without waiting for further information on the
subject, Clay sprang to the motors and the <i>Rambler</i>
was soon making her way upstream.</p>

<p>When they came to a low-lying portion of the
south arm, they saw the lights of the steamer across
the point, trying to head them off.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV.—THE RAMBLER STRIKES BACK.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Just let me get up on the prow with a gun!”
Alex exclaimed, pulling himself out of a puddle
of water on the deck. “I want to get a couple of
shots at those devils on board that steamer!”</p>

<p>“What did they do to you?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“They didn’t do nothing to me, only choked me
nearly to death with the collar of my own shirt,”
said the boy, “but I heard them planning to leave
us lying at the bottom of the lagoon and steal the
boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they’re here for!” Clay answered.
“When you see a whiskey boat on any river, you
may make up your mind that the men on board will
commit murder if they find it necessary.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t get more speed on,” Case exclaimed,
pulling Alex away as he made a dash for
the prow, “they’ll beat us to the entrance to the
lagoon now.”</p>

<p>Clay rushed back to the motors to see if another
ounce of power could not be turned on while Jule
seized the lines and headed the boat off on the port
side.</p>

<p>“They’ll come in from the river side,” he said
to Case, “and we may slip through between their
prow and the little bend which tops the lagoon on
the north side.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was moving much faster than the
steamer, but the latter had several rods the start.
As they raced desperately for the narrow strip of
water between the two arms of the island it was
an open question as to which would win.</p>

<p>“I just believe she’s going to get there first!”
Jule said drawing still farther away to port.
“Can’t you make her go any faster, Clay?”</p>

<p>“Every pound of power is on!” Clay replied.
“You boys would better be getting your guns
ready. If we come together they may try to board
us. If you shoot, shoot to some purpose.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t a-going to come together!” Jule
whispered to Alex, who now occupied a position at
his side. “At least, we’re not going to come
together so they can jump over on our deck.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Alex asked.
“Look here!” Jule queried. “The <i>Rambler</i>’s
sides and prow are braced with steel, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“You know it!” Alex answered with a
chuckle as he began to understand the purpose of
his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” Jule declared, “I’m going to ram
her! If that steamer gets her nose in our way, I’m
going to send the <i>Rambler</i> plumb through her. I
wonder how they’ll like that?”</p>

<p>“If you do,” Alex advised, “reverse the minute
you strike. If you don’t, you are likely to get
wedged into any hole you may make.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m going to send the <i>Rambler</i> clear
through her!” insisted Jule. “I’m going to bang
her with all the force of the motors.”</p>

<p>“Go to it!” Alex exclaimed. “I’m game for
any racket of that kind. Only don’t you say anything
to Clay about it. He’d be afraid of breaking
the motors or something.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was now almost to the entrance.
The steamer was still moving upstream. As the
boys looked the prow of the whiskey boat turned
almost directly into the path which the motor boat
must follow in order to leave the lagoon.</p>

<p>Jeers of triumph arose from the cabin deck of
the steamer as those on board took in the
significance of the situation. They now considered it
certain that the <i>Rambler</i> would soon be at their
mercy, blocked beyond the possibility of escape in the
lagoon.</p>

<p>Jule at the helm of the motor boat, however,
had a very different idea as to how the scene ought
to terminate. In a second the great steamer,
lumbering and loosely built, lay broadside to the
oncoming <i>Rambler</i>. Clay gave a cry of warning as
the boy swirled the boat so as to strike the steamer
amidships, but Jule held on to his course.</p>

<p>Before Clay could utter another cry of warning,
the steel prow of the <i>Rambler</i> crashed into the
steamer about a third back from the prow!</p>

<p>It seemed for a moment as if Jule’s prediction
that he would go clear through the lumbering old
steamer was to be fulfilled, for the steel prow cut
into the thin sides of the steamer as a knife cuts
into cheese. The shock was terrific.</p>

<p>The boys were knocked off their feet, and Jule
found himself rolling on the deck with the tiller
ropes still grasped in his hands!</p>

<p>Shouts of rage and alarm came from the sinking
boat, and there was an immediate rush for the
railing overlooking the motor boat. The steamer was
still staggering under the impact of the blow, and
those on board were reeling like drunken men.</p>

<p>Clay’s first act was to reverse the motors.
Much to his delight and surprise, the <i>Rambler</i>
backed slowly out of the cavity she had cut into
the side of the steamer. The side wall of the
ponderous old boat had been shattered into bits many
feet on either side of the actual cut!</p>

<p>As the <i>Rambler</i> backed away, the steamer
began drifting downstream, moving as chance would
have it, toward the main channel of the river
instead of toward the lagoon. The boys saw at once
that she was filling with water, and would probably
sink where she lay. They saw, too, that men with
pistols in their hands were threatening them from
the cabin deck of the steamer.</p>

<p>With fear and trembling Clay set the motors
going again, wondering whether they had been
injured in the collision so as to render
the <i>Rambler</i> unmanageable. The motors responded
nobly, however, and in a moment the boys had the
satisfaction of seeing her glide past the dipping prow
of the steamer.</p>

<p>It was dark as ink over the surface of the river,
and Alex turned on the lights as the <i>Rambler</i>
rounded the sinking saloon boat and swept on
downstream. Once well under way, Clay walked
up to the prow and looked it over.</p>

<p>“Any harm done?” called Jule.</p>

<p>“No harm that paint and putty won’t repair,”
answered Clay. “That is, not here,” he added.
“Some of you boys would better look into the
cabin.”</p>

<p>The cabin certainly was in a mess. Alex’s cherished
catfish lay rolling on the floor, with Teddy
shambling back and forth after it. Many of the
lockers had been burst open, and a heap of broken
crockery lay on the floor not far from the electric
coils. The glass panel in the cabin door was
shattered, and the coal stove, which had been used in
lower latitudes to keep the boys warm, lay on its
side.</p>

<p>“Everything’s all right in here!” Alex cried
sticking his freckled nose through the sash formerly
occupied by the glass panel. “Nothing wrong
in here at all, except that the stove is tipped over,
and the dishes are all broken, and our expensive
wardrobes are rolling in the dirt, and Teddy’s
eating up my catfish. Oh, we’re all right in here!”</p>

<p>Clay left the prow and looked through into the
cabin.</p>

<p>“We ought to charge this to Jule!” he said with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“All right!” said Jule. “I wouldn’t have
missed that for a thousand dollars. Do you think
I sunk that boat?”</p>

<p>“You certainly did!” answered Clay. “The
last I saw of her as we came around the bend her
cabin lights were shining mighty low.”</p>

<p>“And now,” Case complained, “they’ll be
sending word on down the river to have us arrested
for piracy on the high seas.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think they will!” Alex put in.
“I don’t believe there’s a man on board that boat
that dare step foot either into Indiana or Kentucky.
They sell drugged moonshine whiskey, and they
rob every man that comes on board, so it’s a sure
thing that there’s a warrant for them in every town
along the river.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you had it in you, Jule!” Clay
laughed.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?” Jule questioned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you had the nerve to ram a boat
the size of that one. It was a desperate thing
to do.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grinned Jule. “I guess if I hadn’t
rammed her, we’d be packed like sardines in some
dirty old steamer hold now.”</p>

<p>“And that’s no dream!” Alex shouted.</p>

<p>With her prow light burning brightly, the <i>Rambler</i>
proceeded slowly down the river. In a few
moments they came to four great coal barges
stranded on a sand bar. As they glided by a man
in a rowboat shot out into the circle of light and
called out:</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble up the river, boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Alex answered, “a saloon boat ran into
something and broke in two. I guess she’s sinking.”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a crash of some kind,” answered
the stranger. “Anybody likely to get
drowned?”</p>

<p>“I hope so!” Clay answered. “That’s one of
the meanest outlaw boats on the river. I was glad
to see her going down.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” agreed the other. “I saw the
men on board of her getting the bargemen drunk.
You see the result here. Hundreds of tons of
perfectly good coal wasted.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we run into a cove here, or up against
one of those barges,” Jule whispered, “and see if
this man knows anything about the three blue
lights.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was steered under the lee of the
lower barge downstream from the sand bar and the
stranger rowed alongside.</p>

<p>Clay was about to question him regarding the
phenomenon, now twice witnessed, when the hum
of low voices came from the shore. The boy
listened intently and the next moment the heavy
tramping of horses’ feet came to his ears. Directly
the sharp whinny of a restive horse cut the still air!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI.—THE COAL BARGES INTERVENE.</h2>

<p class='first'>The stranger looked at the boys sharply as they
stood listening to the noises on shore. There
was an expression of displeasure on his face as he
noted how watchful they were.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Sounds like horses and men, replied the
stranger, speaking sharply and turning away as he
did so.</p>

<p>“What are they doing out on the river bank at
this time of night?” queried Jule. “What’s
coming next, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The stranger, who had turned away abruptly, now
moved back so that his face was plainly seen under
the prow light of the <i>Rambler</i>. When he spoke it
was with an attempt at heartiness, but the boys saw
that he was worried.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you all about it,” he began
with an insincere air. “You’ve heard the horses
trampling, and heard the men talking, so you may
as well understand what they’re here for. These
river pirates have been making a lot of trouble lately.
They coax our plantation hands on board their
pesky boats and that’s the last we ever see of them.
There’s many a good crop gone to waste along the
Ohio river because those outlaws carry whiskey to
sell.”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen quite a lot of that,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“Everybody who is on the river sees a lot of it,”
the stranger continued. “Well, now we’ve decided
not to stand it any longer. We came here to
destroy that boat, and I’m half sorry that an accident
prevented our accomplishing the work. One boat
nicely blown up would warn a score away. They
need the lesson.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay laughed, “it wasn’t an accident
that destroyed the steamer. She tried to block us
in the lagoon and we rammed her with our steel
prow. That boat will never make you any more
trouble.”</p>

<p>“You are to be congratulated!” the stranger
observed. “You have my permission to ram every
whiskey boat on the river.”</p>

<p>The man’s face was smiling enough, and his
manner was sufficiently friendly, still the boys all found
themselves wondering if he was telling the exact
truth. They knew very well that many people
scattered along the river on both banks were in
touch with the whiskey boats, even supplying them
with moonshine and tobacco.</p>

<p>“Why don’t some of those men with the horses
show up?” asked Jule presently. “Why are they
hiding in there now?”</p>

<p>“Because they don’t care about being identified
as being mixed up in a raid on a whisky boat!”
was the reply. “Only for the fact that you got
the start of us we could have destroyed that boat
without one of us being recognized. We don’t care
for lawsuits.”</p>

<p>“If they remain here a few hours,” Case suggested,
“they will probably have a chance at another
boat. The <i>Hawk</i> was not far from this place
not very long ago.”</p>

<p>“And you had a bit of a tussle with her?”
laughed the stranger.</p>

<p>“Oh, they got a little gay, but we managed to
keep away from them,” was the reply. “They
tried to steal our boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I presume they would like a trim little
motor boat like yours,” suggested the stranger.
“And now,” he continued, “I may as well get back
to my friends. It will be daylight in an hour or two,
and we’ve got to work at this dirty business in the
dark if we work at all.”</p>

<p>Jule opened his lips to ask the man a question
regarding the three blue lights but Clay, as if
understanding his purpose, drew him back and whispered
in his ear:</p>

<p>“No more questions just now, boy.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Jule asked impatiently. “That’s
just what we came up here for—to find out
something about the three blue lights.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” Clay explained, “that this man
didn’t tell the truth about the other things, and that
he won’t tell the truth about the three blue
lights—that is, if he knows anything about them at all.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been a little bit leary of him all along,”
Jule replied.</p>

<p>While the boys were talking together, the stranger
left the stranded coal barge upon which he had
been standing and, pushing his boat along, joined
his friends on the bank. The boys could hear a
murmur of conversation following his arrival there,
and now and then the light of a match flared up.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I can’t understand,” Clay
said as the boys put out into the current again,
“and that is, why we have seen no wreckage from
the steamer coming down.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” Alex grinned, “the boat must
have dropped into the mouth of the lagoon.”</p>

<p>“No she didn’t!” Case cut in. “She sunk south
of the arm of the island. She’s lying there now in
twenty feet of water unless I am very much
mistaken. Still, we should have seen wreckage by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we take a run up and see what the
situation is there,” suggested Alex. “It would
give me great joy to see a lot of those fellows
marooned on that island, with nothing to eat or drink
for a week.”</p>

<p>“We’ll only get tangled up in some kind of a
mess if we go there,” Clay advised, “so I think
we’d better go on down the river and see if we can’t
shake off all this trouble and have a pleasant,
leisurely river trip. We’ve had trouble in plenty on
all our other trips, but I thought the Ohio journey
would mostly consist of floating in the sunshine
through cities and back yards.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Alex said. “I’m just as willing
to get out of this mess as any one. Anyway, it will
soon be daylight, and we’ll then be needing breakfast.
Who does the cooking this morning?”</p>

<p>“We all cook,” answered Case, “for we all talk
slang except Captain Joe and Teddy, and they
probably have done something in that line themselves
only we didn’t understand them.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” suggested Jule when a faint line
of daylight began to show upstream. “Suppose
we pull over to that wooded cove and build a
roaring fire on the bank. Then we’ll send Alex out to
get another catfish and bake it Indian fashion.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t make a success of Indian cookery on
the St. Lawrence,” suggested Case. “I don’t want
any foolishness about this breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex laughed, “there was something
the matter with the soil over there. I guess it leaked
gas or something of that kind. Anyway, the clay
along the Ohio is all right.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Clay said, “we’ll run into the cove
and give the boy a chance to serve catfish a la
Indian. The combination of gritless clay and green
leaves ought to produce fine results.”</p>

<p>“You just watch me!” Alex insisted.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was accordingly anchored in a
pretty little cove whose banks were covered with
trees of large growth. At first, Alex tried to capture
a fish from the stern, but, not succeeding in this,
he ran out into the river and anchored there, leaving
the other boys on shore. It was broad daylight
when he felt a strong pull at his line and knew that
he had hooked some denizen of the stream.</p>

<p>So busily was he engaged in playing the fish that
he heard nothing of the shouts from upstream, or
the warning from his chums on the bank. Directly,
however, he glanced up to see that a coal tow which
appeared to fill the entire width of the river was
drifting down upon him.</p>

<p>“Get into the cove! Get into the cove!” cried
Clay.</p>

<p>“You’ll be struck in a minute!” shouted Case.</p>

<p>“Release your anchor line and shoot
downstream!” Jule suggested.</p>

<p>This last advice appeared to be not only the most
desirable but the easiest to follow, so the boy
severed the manilla line with one blow of a sharp
hatchet and sprang to the motors. When at last
the boat was under way headed downstream, the
foremost barges were almost upon her.</p>

<p>The men on board the tow seemed to be taking
great delight in the thought that the <i>Rambler</i> would
soon be completely at their mercy. Several of them
stood at the top of their barges making crude and
humorous suggestions to the boy.</p>

<p>With the boat under way and headed downstream
at a speed with which the tow could by no
means compete, Alex amused himself by making
scornful faces at the men on the tow.</p>

<p>“Come back here, you river rat!” one of the
men shouted. “You’ll get a bullet in your back
if you don’t!”</p>

<p>“Fire away!” shouted Alex and promptly
ducked down under the protected gunwale of the
boat.</p>

<p>The boys on shore saw the <i>Rambler</i> speeding
away with many expressions of disgust. Jule even
started on a run down the bank, but soon gave over
the attempt to catch the swiftly disappearing boat.</p>

<p>The men on the tow, observing the boys on the
bank, greeted them with insulting epithets and
amused themselves by heaving chunks of coal toward
them. Case replied with a pistol shot but did
not succeed in wounding any of the men. The coal
came thicker after that for a time, but the
barges were soon too far down the river to make
such an attack effective.</p>

<p>“Now, we’re in a nice box!” Jule cried, as the
steamer in charge of the tow disappeared around
a bend in the river. “How do you suppose that
little monkey will ever get that boat back to us?”</p>

<p>“Aw, that’s easy enough!” Case answered.
“River boats pass those coal tows every day in the
week, and I guess Alex can get the <i>Rambler</i>
upstream again. In fact,” he added, “I don’t think
he needed to run down so far. He might have
ducked over to the other shore and let the barges go
by. Anyway,” the boy added with a smile, “he’ll
lose his fish. And serve him good and right at
that!”</p>

<p>“And we lose our fish breakfast!” Clay returned.
“And that won’t serve us good and right!”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact!” shouted Jule. “We haven’t
got a thing to eat on this bank!”</p>

<p>“We probably won’t have to wait long for the
boy to come back,” Clay assured the others. “He
may be afraid the bargemen will make trouble for
him, and may run down until he comes to the mouth
of a creek or deep cove in which he can hold the
<i>Rambler</i> until the tow passes by. In that case, he
may be away an hour or so, but I reckon we won’t
starve to death in that time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good notion to go and hunt out some
farm house and buy something to eat!” Jule declared.
“We’re most out of eggs, anyway.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” Clay laughed, turning to Case,
“that Alex and Jule have been having most of the
adventures lately. Now what I propose is that you
two boys stay here and wait for the <i>Rambler</i> to
return while I cut back into the country and see what
I can buy in the way of provisions.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right,” Case replied. “And
while you are gone, Jule and I will flop into a thicket
and go to sleep. I’ve had to prop my eyelids open
with my fingers for the last hour. The bulldog
can keep watch while we get our forty winks.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay said, “I didn’t see Captain Joe
come on shore. I guess you’ll find that he’s on board
the boat with Alex and the bear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was here all right,” Case insisted. “I
saw him running about on the other shore of the
cove acting as if he had got scent of a rabbit or a
squirrel.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll be back all right!” Clay replied.
“Be sure that he is before both of you go to sleep.
He’ll stand guard, all right, if you tell him to watch
for Alex. You wouldn’t like to have the <i>Rambler</i>
come back here and not find you!” Clay added.</p>

<p>And so, leaving the boys preparing a bed of leaves
in the thicket, Clay turned away to the south and
disappeared in the forest.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII.—THE TWO CLAIMANTS.</h2>

<p class='first'>Sailing swiftly down the stream in the early
morning, Alex was not at all in bad humor as he
regarded the general situation. He figured that he
could very readily elude the coal tow and return
upstream to his chums. In fact, the portion of the
incident which he regretted most was the loss of
his fish.</p>

<p>“Now,” he pondered as he whirled the boat over
towards the Indiana shore in order to find open
water for his passage upstream, “I’ll have to go
and hook another catfish before we can have breakfast.”</p>

<p>He chuckled softly to himself as he thought of
the chums marooned on the shore of the little cove
without a thing to eat. At the time of his sudden
departure with the <i>Rambler</i>, no supplies of any
kind had been carried ashore. He laughed as he
thought of the rage of the boys.</p>

<p>“I’ll throw out a troll-line as I go up,” he mused,
“and perhaps I’ll have a pickerel or something of
that kind all ready for the hot stones when I get
up to the cove.”</p>

<p>When within a short distance of the Indiana
shore, the boy saw a long line of floats extending
out from the bank, indicating the location of a
fishing net. The boy sprang to the motors in the hope
of saving the net by shutting off the power, but he
was too late. In fact, his effort only made the
meeting with the net more disastrous.</p>

<p>Running at full speed, the boat might have cut
the net and passed on, but drifting with the current
as she was when she came to it, something like two
hundred feet of stout fibre were wound about the
propeller, about the skag, and about the rudder and
rudder-post, as the motors were reversed in an effort
to back away.</p>

<p>As the boy leaned over the stern to ascertain the
extent of the damage, the clatter of the motors died
out and he knew that the clogging of the propellers
had been responsible.</p>

<p>In a moment the <i>Rambler</i> was drifting aimlessly
downstream, swinging this way and that with the
current, spinning along broadside to the wash
of the river oftener than in any other position.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m in a beautiful mess!” the boy declared.
“I shall never be able to get that stuff out
of the propeller without beaching the boat.”</p>

<p>As the boy was lifting a heavy oar in the hope
of sending the motor boat over to the Indiana side
of the river, he heard a slow, drawling hail from the
mouth of a little creek some distance down.</p>

<p>“’Tend to your rudder!” shouted a hoarse voice.
“You’ll go over the rapids in a heap if you keep on
that way!”</p>

<p>“Propeller and rudder clogged!” shouted Alex.
“Come on out and tow me in! You’ll be well paid
for your work.”</p>

<p>The boy thought, in a moment, that the last sentence
had been entirely superfluous, for their experience
on the river had been that waterside characters
were always too willing to assist any crippled
boat. At all times their charges were exorbitant.</p>

<p>“All right!” the man called from the shore, and
then the boy saw a small skiff shoot away from the
side of a dilapidated-looking shanty boat which lay
half hidden by a thicket at the mouth of the creek.</p>

<p>When the man in the skiff reached the <i>Rambler</i>,
he rowed completely around her as if examining
her good points. He was a long, lanky, sour-visaged
individual with long black hair and beard. He was
dressed in the homespun cotton so common with
rivermen.</p>

<p>“Right pert boat you’ve got there,” he said, at
last.</p>

<p>“Never mind the boat now,” Alex answered.
“She’s drifting downstream every minute. Tow
her to shore and help me to get this net out of the
propeller.”</p>

<p>“So it’s a net in the propeller, is it?” snarled
the man from the houseboat. “I hope you hain’t
gone and took up my net.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a net out in the river?” asked
the boy.</p>

<p>“I certainly did!” was the reply. “And if
you’ve gone and cut it up, you’ll pay for it.”</p>

<p>Alex knew very well that the man from the
houseboat had never owned a net of the value of
the one he had destroyed, but he decided to have no
words with the fellow until the <i>Rambler</i> was ready
to proceed on her journey. He saw that the man
was evidently seeking a quarrel.</p>

<p>“Yessir!” the riverman went on. “If you’ve
gone and cut up my net you’ll pay me a good price
for it. There’s too many of you sports romping up
and down the river with your gasoline boats.”</p>

<p>“Time enough to talk about that when we get
the boat over to the shore,” Alex declared. “I
don’t want to drift downstream any farther.”</p>

<p>Scowling and complaining over the exertion
required, the fellow finally managed to work the
<i>Rambler</i> into the mouth of the creek where the
houseboat lay. As Alex took in the situation at
one quick glance, he saw two evil-faced fellows
lounging on the deck of the houseboat.</p>

<p>“What you got, Mose?” one of them called out
to the riverman.</p>

<p>“I’ve salvaged a motor boat!” was Mose’s reply.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble with her?” was the next
question.</p>

<p>“She’s got my net wound around her propeller!”
answered Mose.</p>

<p>“Sho’,” returned the other. “That new net of
yours that cost a hundred not a week ago?”</p>

<p>“Yessir, that same new net!” returned the
riverman.</p>

<p>Alex saw that the men were preparing to make
trouble for him. He knew that they could not
collect a cent of salvage for towing his boat out of the
stream. He was positive that the net did not
belong to them. Houseboat people of their class
consider themselves fortunate in the possession of
ordinary fishing lines and spears.</p>

<p>However, he only smiled as they talked of their
hundred-dollar net, and dropped over into the
shallow water of the creek to inspect the damage done
to the propeller and rudder.</p>

<p>So far as he could see, there was nothing broken.
The net which was wound about everything at the
stern of the boat seemed to him to make a bundle
as large as a whiskey barrel. He took out his knife
preparatory to cutting it away.</p>

<p>“Look here, you boy you!” shouted Mose.
“Don’t you go to cuttin’ up that net. You just
take your consarned old propeller and rudder off the
stern so that we can unwind it.”</p>

<p>Alex knew that this would be impossible. His
idea was to cut the net away, spring to the motors,
and pass out of the reach of the houseboat men
before they suspected what he was up to.</p>

<p>Therefore, he at once set to work with his knife
and began slashing the strong threads of the net.
The three men looked on angrily for an instant and
then Mose said:</p>

<p>“I told you not to cut that net, boy!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there is no other way,” Alex answered
very civilly.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ve got the money in your jeans to
pay for it,” Mose shouted. “If you haven’t, I’ll
just naturally have to take charge of that boat. I
can’t afford to lose that net.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex replied, cutting industriously
away at the obstruction, “my chums are up the
river a short distance and they will be down here
directly. Then we can talk about paying. We’ll
fix you out all right as soon as they get here.”</p>

<p>“You better see that you do!” Mose responded
angrily.</p>

<p>It took some time to cut away the great net, but
the propeller and rudder and skag were free at last
and then Alex climbed back on the deck.</p>

<p>“Here, you,” shouted Mose, presenting the muzzle
of an old-fashioned double-barreled shotgun.
“Don’t you go near those motors. I’ve been
expecting you’d try to run away without paying your
just debts.”</p>

<p>“No fear of my going away just yet,” Alex
answered. “I’ve got to wait somewhere along here
until my chums come.”</p>

<p>While Mose held the rusty old gun in a threatening
manner, his two companions attached a heavy
cable to the forward bitts of the <i>Rambler</i> and
carried it ashore. After winding it around the
trunk of a great tree, they returned to the houseboat
and lay down on the forward deck to gaze
impudently at the boy.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll see if you make a sneak down the
river!” Mose cried triumphantly. “The best way
for you to get away from this creek is to lay down
about a hundred and fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was so much money in the
world!” laughed Alex.</p>

<p>“If your chums don’t come in one hour,” Mose
went on, “we’ll take possession of your boat. This
man here,” pointing over his shoulder with his
thumb, “is a constable! Ain’t you, Clint? And he
can sell your boat right here on the river bank.
Can’t you, Clint? We’ll see if these sports are
coming down here and destroy our property without
paying for it!”</p>

<p>In all his experience in river journeys, Alex had
never been confronted by so puzzling a proposition.
He knew that the rivermen had no claim upon him
whatever, although he considered Mose entitled to
some compensation for his friendly act. Still he
realized that for the time being the fellows held the
whip hand.</p>

<p>It happened that he had considerable money—two
or three hundred dollars in his possession,
having taken charge of the expense fund only a few
days before. His inclination now was to pay the
men the money demanded and get away. Then he
reasoned that the exhibition of such a sum of
money would only arouse the greed of the outlaws.
That they would never let him depart with any
money at all in his possession, he knew very well.
It was a trying situation.</p>

<p>While he stood deliberating over the problem, a
a loud hail came from upstream and turning he saw
the coal tow sweeping down the river.</p>

<p>“Hold that boat!” shouted a harsh voice from
one of the foremost barges. “Hold that boat ’till
we get there.”</p>

<p>Scenting an additional profit in the arrival of the
tow, Mose sprang into his skiff and rowed out. As
the first barge came down, Alex saw two men
spring into the skiff which was at once headed for
the shore. The two men lounging on the houseboat
at once sprang over to the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>, the
man with the rusty shotgun keeping it in full view.</p>

<p>When the skiff reached the <i>Rambler</i>, the two men
clambered on deck while Mose ran the skiff up into
the creek. The two men were extremely well-dressed
although their clothing showed connection
with the water of the river and the smut of the coal
barges. They were both very much excited, and
the first thing one of them did was to shake his fist
under Alex’s, nose.</p>

<p>“Now, you young thief!” he shouted. “We’ve
got you at last!”</p>

<p>“No rough house, pardner!” exclaimed the
houseboat man who held the gun. “No rough
house here, because, you see, we’ve got a claim on
this boy ourselves. He just destroyed a net worth
a hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars!” snarled the whiskey boat
man. “Do you know what he did to us?” he went
on. “He stole this motor boat and sunk our
steamer with it. He’s cost us more than twenty
thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>Alex stood silent in the face of all these
accusations. He had recognized the two men from the
barge as men he had seen on the whiskey boat, and
he knew that they would do their best to make him
trouble. For a moment it seemed to him that the
fate of the <i>Rambler</i> was sealed.</p>

<p>“What do you say to all this, boy?” asked the
man with the gun.</p>

<p>Alex sat down dejectedly on the gunwale.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll let you fellows fight it out between
you,” he said.</p>

<p>“I can’t see as there’s anything to fight out!”
one of the men from the whiskey boat shouted.</p>

<p>“This is our boat and we’re going to take it away!
As for this boy, we’ll place him in the custody of the
first United States marshal we come to!”</p>

<p>Once more the rusty barrel of the old shotgun in
the hands of the houseboat man was hoisted to a
threatening position.</p>

<p>“Don’t you forget,” the man said viciously,
“that this boat busted our net. We don’t care
whose boat it is, we’re going to hold it until we get
paid for our property!”</p>

<p>“You talk like a fool!” shouted the man from
the steamer.</p>

<p>“And you act like a fool!” insisted the other.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you fellows ever owned any
net!” the enraged outlaw shouted. “I’ve seen your
old houseboat sneaking along the river here for
months. You’re the kind of men who never have
the price of a drink unless you can steal it. If you
try to hold this boat, I’ll fill you both full of bullet
holes!”</p>

<p>The eyes at the stock of the shotgun flashed
wickedly, but the man’s voice was remarkably
smooth as he said:</p>

<p>“If you move, either one of you, or try to get
out a gun I’ll blow the tops of your heads off! You
observe,” he went on, “that there are two barrels
to this gun, and I’ll tell you right now that they’re
both loaded with slugs.”</p>

<p>“This is nonsense!” roared the man from the
steamer.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve been calculatin’,” replied the
other.</p>

<p>Alex was thinking fast. It seemed to him at that
time that it would be better to leave the <i>Rambler</i>
in the hands of the houseboat men than in those of
the men from the steamer.</p>

<p>The houseboat men would be satisfied with a
small amount of money as soon as they discovered
that they could get no more, while the other
outlaws would insist on taking the <i>Rambler</i> for their
alleged debt.</p>

<p>Taking this view of the situation, he turned to
the man who was holding the shotgun.</p>

<p>“These two men,” he said, “are whiskey boat
men. They have no more claim on this boat than
you have.”</p>

 <h2 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII.—A FORBIDDEN SUBJECT.</h2>

<p class='first'>While Alex was having his troubles with the
two gangs of outlaws, and while Jule and Case were
asleep in a thicket at the cove, Clay was pushing
his way through a heavy undergrowth in the direction
of a shabby-looking farm house which stood
in the center of a weed-grown tobacco field not far
away.</p>

<p>As he approached the uncared for fence which
surrounded the field, he heard horses stamping and
champing at their bits in the woods not far away
to his left.</p>

<p>At first he thought seriously of visiting the
undergrowth on a tour of investigation, but finally
decided that his actions might be misconstrued, so he
passed on toward the house in the tobacco field.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that half a hundred dogs of all
sizes and breeds leaped out as he advanced through
the weeds toward the front door.</p>

<p>He was having his hands full with the dogs,
fending them off, when the door opened and a woman
made her appearance on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Down, you ornery purps!” she shouted in a
voice that sounded more like that of a man than
that of a woman. “Come right along in, stranger,”
she added. “I reckon they won’t bite you up
none.”</p>

<p>Under the protection of the woman’s voice and
presence, Clay finally succeeded in making his way
to the house.</p>

<p>“I’m sure ashamed of them ornery purps,” the
woman declared, striking at a large brindle dog
with a mop stick. “Somehow I can’t beat no manners
into ’em!”</p>

<p>“They appear to be a fine lot of dogs!” Clay
said, resolved to conciliate the woman if possible.
“I’m used to Kentucky dogs, so I was not at all
afraid of them.”</p>

<p>“What mought be your business, stranger?” the
woman asked then.</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay answered, “I’m looking for
something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Sho’!” answered the woman. “A nice, likely
lookin’ lad like you goin’ around hungry! I’d be
glad to give you a set-down of flapjacks and coffee.
Come right in.”</p>

<p>“That would help some!” laughed Clay. “But
what I want is provisions to carry away to my
chums—eggs, chickens or anything of that sort
you may have to sell.”</p>

<p>“And where mought your chums be?” asked the
woman, a little suspiciously as Clay thought.</p>

<p>“We came down the river in a motor boat,” the
boy replied, “and I left the boys in a cove some
distance from here.”</p>

<p>“I wonder, now,” the woman queried, “whether
you might have been on the river last night.”</p>

<p>Clay replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Well,” the woman went on, “I’ve been waiting
all morning for news from the river. My men
went out last night at dusk and haven’t returned.”</p>

<p>“There were horsemen along the river last
night,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“That would be them.”</p>

<p>“And I heard horses champing their bits just as
I came up to the fence,” Clay went on.</p>

<p>“Sho’!” answered the woman. “My men always
have fresh hosses near the house. What did
you hear on the river last night?” she added.</p>

<p>“It seemed rather quiet,” Clay replied, “except
that a whiskey steamer got wrecked some distance up.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad, now!” declared the woman.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing peculiar I noticed about the
river last night,” Clay went on, “and that was something
which looked to me like a signal. We saw
three blue lights resting on the surface of the water.
Then there came an explosion and they disappeared.”</p>

<p>The woman almost staggered back in the doorway.
Her ruddy face became slightly pale, and
Clay saw that the work-worn hands were trembling.</p>

<p>Clay sprang to a pail of water which stood near,
dipped up a liberal supply in a gourd which hung
on a wall, and approached the woman with it in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Sho’, now!” the woman almost gasped, placing
her hands at her sides, “here I be havin’ another
spell with my heart. Seems like I was always havin’
trouble with that pesky organ.”</p>

<p>Clay did not believe the explanation given by the
woman for her sudden fright. He had no doubt
that the mention of the mysterious three blue lights
had led to this alleged heart failure.</p>

<p>“I’ll shore be better in a minute,” the woman
said, dropping into a home-made chair which stood
just inside the house. “What was it you said about
the three blue lights? I was took sudden just as
you began speaking of them.”</p>

<p>Clay repeated what he had said regarding the
mysterious lights, watching the woman closely every
second. She did not again show sign of emotion
of any kind.</p>

<p>“Why,” the woman said directly, “them’s the
ghost lights that are often seen on the Ohio. The
steamboat <i>Mary Ann</i> went down with a dancing
party on board ten years ago, and ever since then
the lights have been seen on the river.”</p>

<p>“But the <i>Mary Ann</i> went down just off Wolf
Creek,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“There is a story,” the woman began in a
hushed voice, “that the lights show every year about
the time the boat went down, at the exact place
where she sunk. And then, again,” she continued,
“they do say that wherever a body from the <i>Mary Ann</i>
remains unburied at the bottom of the river
the three blue lights show at least once a year.”</p>

<p>“So they really are ghost lights?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Why, stranger,” the woman continued, “boats
have been pushed directly into them lights as they
floated on the surface of the river, and they have
burned right on after being submerged! Them
explosions have been heard time and time again, and
nothing has been found which could have produced
them. We people along the river are mighty skeery
of them ghost lights.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that they bring disaster,” Clay
suggested.</p>

<p>“They sure do!” replied the woman. “But
come in,” she went on, “here I’ve been talkin’ like
a foolish old gossip, and you standing hungry in
the doorway. Come in and sit down.”</p>

<p>Clay took the proffered chair but he was not
thinking of the breakfast being prepared for him.</p>

<p>He was thinking, instead, of the sudden panic
into which the old woman had fallen at the mention
of the three blue lights. He saw now that there
was some significance to the signal.</p>

<p>He came to understand, sitting there watching
the still troubled face of the woman, that the three
blue lights indicated some desperate action on the
part of the river people—some desperate action
which took the men away from their homes and
left the women anxious and afraid. He saw that
the woman in trying to deceive him by her words
was still telling the story of some terrible situation
by her voice and manner. He wondered but could
reach no conclusion.</p>

<p>The boy was supplied with a bountiful breakfast
of corn pancakes, fried eggs and coffee, and then he
opened negotiations with his hostess for a supply
of provisions for the <i>Rambler</i>. The woman looked
distressed and answered his inquiries with
downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m sure sorry,” she said, “but we had a lot of
friends here to dinner yesterday, and they eat about
everything in the house. Them eggs you’ve just et
were laid this morning.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” Clay replied, “but if you
haven’t got provisions, you can’t sell them.
Perhaps I can find a supply at some near-by farm house.
How far is it to the nearest one?”</p>

<p>“It is a long way through the thicket,” the woman
answered, “and I wouldn’t advise no boy like
you to be wandering in the woods in this vicinity
right now. It ain’t safe!”</p>

<p>“Why, there ought not to be anything to be
afraid of!” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“You don’t know this region as well as I do,
boy!” the woman replied. “These folks that come
up from the river are mighty bad sometimes, and
I’ve known people that didn’t live on the river to
do desperate, bad things occasionally.”</p>

<p>Clay sorely puzzled, looked the woman frankly in
the face and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you imagine trouble because the three blue
lights showed on the river last night?”</p>

<p>“Well,” was the reply, “they surly do bring
trouble.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” insisted Clay.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s wrecks, and burnings, and shooting,
and all manner of things going on, somehow,
after them three blue lights show.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps I’d better be getting back to the
river!” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t leave no boat that was worth ready
money long alone along the Ohio river at this time
of year,” the woman answered. “And let me tell
you another thing,” she went on. “If you see
three blue lights, keep away from them! Don’t go
near where they are, and get out of the vicinity of
them as fast as you can.”</p>

<p>“We’re not afraid of ghosts!” laughed Clay.</p>

<p>“I can’t say more!” the woman continued. “I
don’t know but I’ve said too much now. I hope
you’ll take an old woman’s advice and keep out of
trouble. Where might you boys be from, now?”</p>

<p>“Chicago,” replied Clay.</p>

<p>“Sho’, now!” exclaimed the old woman. “I’ve
never seen any one from Chicago before. “I’ve
heard of it often, though. Must be a right pert
place. Some one told me it was almost as big as
Paducah.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clay replied, “Chicago is some city.
Will you accept pay for my breakfast?” he
continued.</p>

<p>“You’re only a boy,” the woman replied, “and
so don’t know any better than to offer a Kintucky
woman pay for a feed. But I wouldn’t do that any
more if I were you.”</p>

<p>Thanking the woman from the bottom of his
heart for her hospitality and her kindly advice, the
boy started away in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>On his return he took care to pass through that
portion of the thicket where he had heard the horses
on his way in. He found three remarkably fine-looking
animals, all saddled and bridled, standing
in the thicket. As he stepped toward one of them,
a boy, certainly not more than twelve years of age,
leaped at him.</p>

<p>“What you doing here?” the youth demanded.</p>

<p>“I have just come from the house,” Clay replied.
“Your mother gave me a fine breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Did she, now?” asked the boy suspiciously.</p>

<p>“She certainly did,” answered Clay resolved to
continue the conversation with the lad until he
learned something more concerning the three blue
lights. The boy dropped his hostile attitude at
once.</p>

<p>“I was going on to other houses in search of
provisions,” Clay went on, “but your mother
advised me that it wouldn’t be safe.”</p>

<p>“It shore ain’t safe!” the boy replied.</p>

<p>“She told me,” Clay resumed, “that it was never
safe in this section when three blue lights burned
on the river.”</p>

<p>“Did she, now?” asked the boy. “And did you-all
see the three blue lights?”</p>

<p>“Twice,” answered Clay. “Last night and the
night before—once opposite Wolf Creek and once in
the lagoon at that odd-shaped island just up the
stream.”</p>

<p>Clay thought that the boy shivered a little in his
ragged clothes.</p>

<p>“What is all this about the three blue lights?”
he asked in a moment.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“We-uns ain’t allowed to talk about the three
blue lights,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You think they are ghost lights, eh?” asked
Clay.</p>

<p>“We-uns ain’t allowed to talk about the three
blue lights,” repeated the boy. “We never mention
them.”</p>

<p>Seeing that further conversation with the boy
was likely to prove without result, Clay again turned
to face in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew,” he mused, as he pushed his
way through tangled thickets and descended and
ascended rocky slopes, “I wish I knew exactly why
that woman came near fainting when I mentioned
the three blue lights.</p>

<p>“I have an impression,” he went on, “that there’s
some feud coming to life. In the first place, I don’t
believe the story told at the stranded coal barges
last night.</p>

<p>“Those men never sought the river with the intentions
of destroying that steamer. They wouldn’t
have brought their horses along if that had been
their object.</p>

<p>“The horses, of course, might have been used in
the way of transportation to the river, but, at the
same time, men out on such a mission would not
care to be seen riding so openly through the
country.”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the boy did not believe
one word of the story told him by the woman who
had given him his breakfast. He was too
hard-headed to believe in ghosts or supernatural
demonstrations of any sort.</p>

<p>He knew however, that there must be some reason
for the display of the lights, and knew that no little
ingenuity had been shown in the placing and
extinguishing of them. So studying over the
problem, the boy finally came to the little cove where he
had left Case and Jule.</p>

<p>Captain Joe fawned about him as he advanced,
but when he approached the thicket where the boys
had been preparing their rough beds, he saw that
they were not there. He lost no time in making a
close examination of the ground, both at the landing
and at the entrance to the thicket.</p>

<p>What he saw set his heart to bounding excitedly:
At both points there many indications of a
desperate struggle.</p>

<p>Had he known the plight in which Alex found
himself at that moment, Clay would have been
doubly alarmed.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX.—TEDDY MAKES A SENSATION.</h2>

<p class='first'>“What’s that you say?” thundered one of the
men from the steamer, as Alex explained to the
houseboat men that neither party had any interest
whatever in the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“You’d better keep truth on your side, young
man!” the other whiskey boat man put in.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Alex declared, dodging away
from one of the men who made an attempt to seize
him. “That’s right! These whiskey boat men
never saw this craft until last night. We rammed
their steamer because they tried to block us in a
lagoon, and I hope we sunk her.”</p>

<p>“You did all of that!” one of the others replied.</p>

<p>“According to the boy’s statement,” Mose cut
in, “you fellows have no right on this boat at all,
so I’d advise you to make yourself skurce.”</p>

<p>The recent arrivals saw that they were not
making good in their bluff to the houseboat men and so
resorted to sterner measures.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash one of them seized the muzzle of
the rusty old shotgun, drew it away from the
clumsy hands holding it, and dropped the weapon
into the river. Almost at the same instant, two
automatic revolvers flashed out of the hip pockets
of the outlaws.</p>

<p>“Now,” the man who had been doing most of the
talking thundered, “you river thieves get off this
boat!”</p>

<p>“We will when we get pay for our net!”</p>

<p>“You never owned a net!” shouted the other.
“You never had the price of a dozen fish hooks at
one time, say nothing about a net!”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Mose insisted, “I brought you over
to this boat and kept the boy from running away
before you got here.”</p>

<p>“Now, you’re talking sense,” the outlaw sneered.
“Throw him a couple of dollars, Chet,” he added.</p>

<p>The fellow’s companion tossed two silver dollars
scornfully down on the deck and turned to Alex.</p>

<p>“You get into the cabin,” he said, “and stay
there. We’ll settle with you later on.”</p>

<p>Alex had no idea of remaining on board the
<i>Rambler</i> after it had passed into the possession of
the outlaws. He knew that the desire for revenge
on their part might lead to murder. He had no fear
of being turned, over to the officers of the law, for
the outlaws were in no position to make charges
against others. He stepped into the cabin as
requested and closed the door after him.</p>

<p>“Now, Teddy Bear,” he said, “you and I have
got to jump away from this darling old boat, and
we’ve got to do it right soon.”</p>

<p>Teddy, awakened from a sound sleep, scratched
his nose with a soft paw and replied in the most
polite of bear talk that he would do whatever Alex
thought best.</p>

<p>The men who belonged on the houseboat were by
this time off the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>. The outlaws,
however, were watching the boy very closely. They
laughed when they saw him talking with the bear.</p>

<p>“That’s a cute pet you have there!” one of the
men exclaimed, speaking through the broken panel
of the door.</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” Alex answered cheerfully.
“Teddy Bear is a pretty good friend. We’ve had
him a long time.”</p>

<p>“What’re you going to do with him?” asked the
outlaw.</p>

<p>“Take him back to Chicago with us.”</p>

<p>The outlaws laughed and regarded the boy and
the bear with humorous faces. Alex sat down and
watched them curiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t see you getting back to Chicago right
away,” one of them finally said. “That is, not to-day
nor to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re going down to Cairo first!” Alex
grinned.</p>

<p>The two outlaws turned away with a laugh, and
as soon as their backs were in view Alex opened
the swinging sash of the rear window and motioned
for Teddy to leap out.</p>

<p>The bear cub followed instructions, and landed
lightly on the after deck. In an instant Alex was
through the window and the two sprang into the
water and made for the shore.</p>

<p>The outlaws would doubtless have remained unconscious
of the escape until the boy and his companion
had reached the thicket only that the men on
the houseboat shouted and pointed at the bear.</p>

<p>“Look at the menagerie!” one of them cried.</p>

<p>This brought the outlaws to the shore-side of the
boat, and directly several harmless bullets whizzed
close to the two swimmers.</p>

<p>“Go it, boy! Go it, bear!” was shouted from the
houseboat.</p>

<p>The three men already disgruntled by the manner
in which they had been treated by the outlaws, were
now inclined to support Alex and the bear in their
efforts to escape.</p>

<p>While the men on the <i>Rambler</i> sent badly aimed
bullets after the two in the water, the men on the
houseboat hurled billets of wood and whatever else
they could lay their hands on at the outlaws.</p>

<p>This action on their part, while doing no physical
harm whatever, had the effect of directing the
attention of the outlaws from the boy and the bear to
the three men. When Alex and Teddy disappeared
in the thicket on the east side of the little creek,
immediately in the rear of the houseboat, the outlaws
were still firing, and the others were still pitching
wood and pieces of coal over the deck of the motor
boat.</p>

<p>After a very long run upstream, out, perhaps fifty
yards from the water’s edge, the boy and the bear
threw themselves down on the moss beneath a forest
tree and panted out congratulations to each other
on their escape.</p>

<p>“Teddy,” almost whimpered Alex. “We’ve
gone and lost the <i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>The bear looked very grave indeed.</p>

<p>“We’ve gone and lost the <i>Rambler</i>!” Alex went
on, “and have nothing to show for it at all! I set
out to catch a fish, and lost the boat!”</p>

<p>Teddy rubbed his soft muzzle against Alex’s,
cheek and looked sympathetic. He seemed to
understand every word said.</p>

<p>“And now, bear,” the boy went on, “we’ve got
to walk five or ten miles up this bank of the river
and swim across. I guess the boys must be pretty
near a dozen miles away.”</p>

<p>Teddy, while looking sympathetic, thrust his
muzzle into Alex’s, pocket looking for crackers.</p>

<p>“Je—rusalem!” exclaimed Alex. “I wish I had
some, Teddy. I never was so empty in my life!”</p>

<p>After a short rest, the boy arose and the two
proceeded on their difficult journey. Now and then
they came to weedy fields where corn had been
grown and where great shocks of stalks still stood,
but for the most part their way lay through a narrow
slice of forest which fringed the river. Alex took
occasion, after a time, to investigate some of the
corn shocks but found no ears.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon,” the boy mused, “I’ll be hungry
enough to eat the stalks. And the boys must be
hungry, too,” he went on, “but all the provisions
we had are on board the <i>Rambler</i>. I don’t know
what they’ll say to me when I go back and explain
what happened.”</p>

<p>After a long, long walk, during which it seemed
to the boy that he had covered at least a score of
miles, he discerned on the opposite bank of the
river the little cove in which the <i>Rambler</i> had been
moored that morning. Although he strained his
eyes hoping to see the familiar figures of his chums,
he could see no motion whatever.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve got starved out and gone away,”
the boy complained. “I suppose when I get over
there, there’ll be only a burned-out camp-fire and
nothing to eat. The next time I go out fishing for
catfish, I won’t go. It always brings bad luck.”</p>

<p>Realizing that he might have to swim across the
whole width of the river, the boy kept on upstream
knowing that it would be better to have the current
in his favor when he entered the water.</p>

<p>While he sat looking across the stream, several
river craft passed, some going up and some going
down. Once he thought of calling to a small motor
boat and asking the occupants to ferry him across
the river. But he soon changed his mind not
knowing what sort of people he would be likely to find
in any of the river boats.</p>

<p>While the boy stood near the bank of the river
looking out, Teddy, as usual, was nosing about
looking for something to eat. The boy had hardly
noticed the absence of the bear when a succession of
long shrill squealings came from a thicket not far
distant.</p>

<p>“There!” the boy mused, starting away on a run.
“Teddy has gone and scared the life out of some
one.”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake! Fo’ de Lawd’s sake!”</p>

<p>The voice died away, and was succeeded by a
commotion in the bushes just ahead of the running
boy.</p>

<p>The next moment a little short, fat, dumpy negro
with a fringe of gray hair running around an
otherwise bald head, came into view, trying to run very
fast, but succeeding only in stumbling over every
obstruction which came in his way, and landing
flat on his back with his heels high up in the air.
The sight was indeed a comical one.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake! Fo’ de Lawd’s sake!”
repeated the negro, his eyes rolling in his head like
great white marbles.</p>

<p>Teddy, evidently unconscious of the sensation he
was creating, came dashing after the fallen darkey,
and at once assumed a boxing attitude.</p>

<p>“Take him away! Take him away!” roared
the negro. “Ah’s done bein’ eat up! Take de b’ar
away, take him away!”</p>

<p>Instead of taking the bear away, Alex, hungry
and tired as he was, threw himself down on the
grass and roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“Ah’s done bein’ eat up!” shouted the negro although
Teddy was at least two yards away.</p>

<p>“He won’t hurt you,” Alex said as soon as he
could control his voice. “Teddy is a tame bear.”</p>

<p>“Ah never did take to bears!” the negro shouted
rolling his fat body farther away. “Ah don’ see
no good in b’ars.”</p>

<p>After some persuasion the boy induced the negro
to come nearer. This he did with fear and trembling,
and ever with a watchful eye on the playful
cub.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Uncle Zeke,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Do you live here?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“Ah libs way up de ribber,” was the guarded
reply.</p>

<p>“Then you must have come down in a boat?”
asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Ah sure did!” answered the negro.</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex said then, “we want to get over
to the other side of the river. Will you take us
across?”</p>

<p>The negro backed away from the bear again and
seemed to be about to take to his heels. He turned
back in a moment, however, as if anxious to be
friendly with the boy and declared:</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did cotton to no b’ar!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t hurt you,” the boy explained,
“he’s just a tame cub. We’ve had him ever since
he was as big as a kitten. Row us across to that
little cove over there and I’ll give you a dollar.”</p>

<p>Uncle Zeke fingered his bald pate and entered
into negotiations for the job, still with his eyes fixed
suspiciously on Teddy.</p>

<p>“Ah’ll done row you over for a dollar,” he said.</p>

<p>“But the bear’s got to go,” Alex insisted.</p>

<p>“Dat’ll be anudder dollar,” insisted Uncle Zeke.</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex laughed, “where’s your
boat?”</p>

<p>Delighted with having made so good a bargain,
Uncle Zeke led the way to the river bank not far
away and pointed out a fair-sized rowboat rocking
in the water.</p>

<p>“Why!” Alex exclaimed excitedly. “Where
did you get that boat?”</p>

<p>“Ah bought it,” replied the negro.</p>

<p>The boat was the one belonging to the <i>Rambler</i>!</p>

<p>It had been left, it will be remembered, on the
Kentucky shore of the river some distance above Wolf
Creek. The boys who had landed in search of
gasoline and spark plugs had left it hidden in a thicket.
During their absence, the <i>Rambler</i> had made her
way downstream for some distance, and so the
rowboat had not been recovered. It looked familiar
to Alex now.</p>

<p>“Where did you buy it?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Niggerman sold me dat boat,” answered the
other.</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex said. “Take us across and
I’ll give you the two dollars.”</p>

<p>He had no intention of leaving the <i>Rambler</i>’s boat
in the possession of the negro, but he thought it
advisable not to make any claim to the boat until he
had reached the other side of the river.</p>

<p>With Teddy sitting at the very stern of the boat
as far as possible from the rower, the two were
ferried across, striking the bank a few paces above
the east shore of the cove.</p>

<p>“Now,” Alex said as he stepped ashore, “come
on over to the camp and I’ll give you your money.”
Uncle Zeke eyed the bear critically.</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did cotton to no b’ar!” he said.</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex went on, “you’ll have to come
over to the camp or I can’t give you your money.”
Very reluctantly the fat, old negro waddled over
to the heap of embers which was all that remained
of the fire the boys had built early that morning.
Alex’s wandering attention was brought back to
the negro directly by a short, sharp cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake!” he cried. “Fo’ de
Lawd’s sake!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX.—THE PIRATES’ NEST.</h2>

<p class='first'>Alex sprang to his feet just as Captain Joe
came dashing up to the negro, looking fierce enough
to consume him at one bite.</p>

<p>If there had been any extra hair at the top of the
old negro’s pate it must have stood horizontal at
that moment, for Teddy shambled up to the bulldog
and began a series of boxing antics such as the old
fellow had never witnessed before.</p>

<p>“Gimme mah two dollahs!” he finally managed
to shout. “Gimme mah two dollahs, and Ah’ll
done go ’way!”</p>

<p>Before Alex could reply, Clay came into the
little opening and stood gazing about with
wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you see Case and Jule?” was the first
question he asked of Alex.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head silently.</p>

<p>“I left them here!” he said.</p>

<p>Clay stepped toward the bank and looked out
over the cove.</p>

<p>“Where is the <i>Rambler</i>?” he asked, not
without anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>“The pirates got her!” was Alex’s reply, and
there were actually tears in his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>During this short conversation between the two
boys, Uncle Zeke had stood, trembling, by the heap
of embers, gazing from boy to boy and from bear
to dog.</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did cotton to no bulldog!” he said.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?” asked Clay,
forgetting for a moment what Alex’s reply meant to the
party.</p>

<p>“That’s Uncle Zeke,” answered Alex with a
grin. “He rowed Teddy and I across the river.”</p>

<p>“Ah’m goin’ to hab two dollahs!” put in the
negro.</p>

<p>Clay again turned toward Alex, his manner
showing great excitement.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it!” he said kindly.</p>

<p>Alex told the story, already well known to the
reader, in as few words as possible. Clay did not
interrupt him, and at the close stood looking out on
the river with a very grave face.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get her back!” Alex shouted in
a moment. “We’ve just got to get the <i>Rambler</i>
back!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Clay said stubbornly, “of course!
I was only thinking how. There surely must be
some way.”</p>

<p>“Where are Case and Jule?” Alex now asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” was the reply. “I went away
to look up something to eat, and when I came back,
they were not here.”</p>

<p>“They probably went after something to eat,
too!” Alex suggested.</p>

<p>“No,” Clay went on, “I was to bring back provisions,
if I succeeded in finding any. When I
returned, Captain Joe was here, but they were
gone.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange!” Alex muttered. “I don’t
see why they should leave camp when they were
expecting you to bring them something to eat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they left the camp voluntarily,”
Clay continued. “If you’ll look at the head of
the cove, and at the side of the thicket where they
were preparing their beds, you’ll see evidences of a
struggle.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is,” Alex began, “those
pirates from the steamer we sunk got down here on
that coal tow and swam ashore.”</p>

<p>“That is very likely!” Clay replied. “We
know, at least, that two of them were on the coal
tow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the boy went on, “they saw the fire
here, and recognized the <i>Rambler</i> lying just below
the barges, and swam ashore to punish us for
ramming their old whiskey boat.”</p>

<p>“There may be something in that,” Clay returned.</p>

<p>“And, then, after the <i>Rambler</i> was crowded
downstream, and after you went away to get something
to eat, they attacked the two boys and lugged
them away. I wish we’d killed them all.”</p>

<p>“You’re the bloodthirsty little fellow this morning!”
Clay smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” Alex responded. “Just think
of our motor boat, with all the provisions and
ammunition on board, falling into the hands of those
outlaws! I’ll just tell you right now, Clay,” he went
on, flushing with anger, “if I’d had a stick of
dynamite handy, I’d have set the fuse on fire before I
crawled out of the cabin window.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m glad you didn’t have any dynamite
handy!” smiled Clay.</p>

<p>Uncle Zeke, who had been standing motionless
in mortal terror of the dog and the bear, now
stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Ah done hear what you-all said,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Clay answered, “have you any idea
in your head at all which points to the recovery of
our motor boat?”</p>

<p>“Ah nebber done cotton to dem pirates,” said
the negro.</p>

<p>“Well, then, show us how to get our boat back!”
Alex laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah suah will,” replied the negro. “Dem
pirates,” he continued, “has a nes’ nex’ de big bend
Ah been dere many a time. You go more ’n forty
miles aroun’ de ben’ an’ you go ten miles across.”</p>

<p>“Aw!” laughed Alex. “There isn’t any such
bend on the Ohio river in this vicinity. There’s a
bend below here that makes a circuit of about ten
or twelve miles to get one mile downstream.”</p>

<p>“Ah don’ know ’bout no miles,” Uncle Zeke
answered. “Ah know ’bout dat pirate’s nes’ at de
horseshoe ben’.”</p>

<p>“Can you get across the neck in a rowboat?”
asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Ah suah can,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know, did you, that the boat you
have is one that belonged to our motor boat? We
lost it a ways up the river.”</p>

<p>“Ah done gib two yaller-legged hens for dat
boat,” insisted Uncle Zeke. “Ah buy it of a black
nigger.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it was abandoned property,
anyway,” Clay said, “so we’ll pay you for it if we find
that we need it again.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI.—FATE TAKES A TRICK.</h2>

<p class='first'>Left alone in the thicket at the head of the cove,
Case and Jule waited for some time for the
appearance of Captain Joe. While not actually afraid
of any attack upon themselves in that quiet place,
they much preferred leaving the bulldog on watch
when they went to sleep.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe ought to be here before long,”
Case observed searching the thickets with his eyes
in the hope of discerning the bulky form of the dog.
“It is a rare thing for him to go away alone, but
when he has done so in the past he soon returns.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d come back right now,” Jule replied,
“I’m so sleepy I couldn’t eat a breakfast if we had
one. Look here, Case,” he went on, “why is it
that we always have such infernal bad luck when
we start out on a river trip? Its been night-and-day
trouble ever since we left Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case replied, “and it was night-and-day
trouble on the Amazon, and on the Columbia, and
on the Colorado, and on the Mississippi, and on the
St. Lawrence. I’ll tell you what I think we ought
to do,” he continued with a grin, “we ought to
take an aeroplane along so we could mount up into
the blue sky when things got mixed.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind being several miles up in the
blue sky right now,” Jule laughed, “if I could find
a nice soft cloud to sleep on. They look like
feather beds, don’t they?” he asked, pointing to
wandering clouds in the sky some of them tipped
with the early sunlight.</p>

<p>“They certainly do,” answered Case, “but I’m
afraid you wouldn’t find them very soft or very
dry. In fact, you’d fall right through and probably
tumble into the river. Did it ever occur to you,”
he went on, “that a cloud is a great big bluff? It
looks solid and handsome, and all that, from the
surface of the earth, but it’s nothing but a great
big fog.”</p>

<p>“I never lost much time considering clouds,
Jule replied. “Suppose you go out into the woods
and see if you can’t find Captain Joe.”</p>

<p>“No use to look for him,” Case replied, “if he’s
got the trail of a rabbit, he’ll run from now until
next week at two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go to sleep,” Jule proposed. “We
can lie right down here in the thicket, and if anyone
should come poking around, they wouldn’t be
able to see us. We didn’t have any sleep last night
at all, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s the matter with the bunch,
anyway,” Case said, rather crossly. “Clay goes off
to get breakfast and doesn’t come back, and Alex
goes out to get fish and gets chased off by a coal
tow, and Captain Joe runs away and doesn’t return!”</p>

<p>“Alex ought to be here by this time,” Jule complained.
“There’s plenty to eat on board the
<i>Rambler</i>, so if Clay doesn’t find any provisions we
won’t go hungry. Everything seems to be going
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Moved and supported that we go to sleep,” Case
replied. “The ayes have it! Motion prevails!
You just watch now and see me flop down here in
the bushes. I’m going to sleep a week!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Jule answered with a yawn.
“When it comes to sleeping, you haven’t got anything
on me.”</p>

<p>“And when we wake up,” Case continued,
“we’ll see the <i>Rambler</i> riding out there in the cove,
with Alex cooking the catfish a la Indian, and Clay
exhibiting the eggs and milk he bought at some
romantic farm house.”</p>

<p>“Go to sleep and dream all that!” Jule snorted.</p>

<p>The boys lay down on the beds of leaves which
they had prepared in the undergrowth and were
soon sound asleep. After all, they had nothing
serious to worry over, for they both believed that a
situation something like that forecast by Case would
present itself when they awoke.</p>

<p>The sun rising over the river cast long lances of
light into the thicket where they lay. The cool
breeze of the morning stirred the leaves about them
like a lullaby. The birds darted and sang in the
sweet air. The scene was as peaceful and pastoral
as one might well imagine.</p>

<p>But only for a time. Directly the heavy tramp of
horses was heard, the rattling of rings and the
champing of bits.</p>

<p>The riders, a score or more, advanced through
the woods to the cove and halted on the east shore.
There they tied their horses to trees and threw
themselves upon the ground. They were sturdy
men, clean-limbed, alert, with fierce eyes and
determined faces.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the presence of the riders, the
boys slept on. Presently a lean hound belonging to
the company ran sniffing and snarling around to the
thicket where Case and Jule lay. There he sat up
such a baying as might have awakened the Seven
Sleepers.</p>

<p>The two boys sleepily rubbed their eyes and
looked about. It seemed to them at first that
Captain Joe had returned, but they soon saw the
difference between the lean hound and the white
bulldog.</p>

<p>“What’s got into your dog, Peck?” one of the
men asked.</p>

<p>“He’s found something in the bushes.”</p>

<p>“The consarned brute is always finding
something in the bushes, when we want to keep under
cover!” snarled the other man.</p>

<p>“Look here, Hart,” Peck said sternly, “you let
the dog alone. He’s done us many a good turn in
his time, and he’s likely to do more. I wasn’t
thinking about the dog at all,” Peck went on.
“Just take a couple of sniffs at the air and see if you
can locate that wood fire.”</p>

<p>“There surely is a fire hereabouts!” Hart
answered in a conciliating tone. “Perhaps there
are tramps here and the dog has come and caught
them. If so, we’ll send them about their business.”</p>

<p>The two men arose, passed around the cove and
soon came to the thicket where Case and Jule were
struggling to their feet rubbing their eyes sleepily
as they did so.</p>

<p>“Hello here!” Hart exclaimed. “This seems
to be quite a find.”</p>

<p>The two boys, now thoroughly awake, reached
for their automatics as they gained their feet. The
men’s faces glared down upon them sinister and
suspicious.</p>

<p>They glanced eagerly about hoping to see the
<i>Rambler</i> riding in the cove but, as the reader
understands, the motor boat was not there. Clay had not
returned and the fire built for the purpose of
cooking the fish had burned down to embers.</p>

<p>“None of that, boys!” Peck threatened as Case
and Jule reached their hands back to their hip
pockets. “You don’t have to draw any guns on
us.”</p>

<p>“If you try it,” Hart cut in angrily, “you’ll
get a taste of good birch rods. We have no time
to fool with boys.”</p>

<p>By this time the men lounging on the bank of
the cove were on their feet, taking note of what was
going on near the fire. Seeing their companions
talking with two boys who seemed to them to be
tramps, they dropped back to the ground again
without interest.</p>

<p>A tall, rather pleasant looking man however soon
left the group and approached the place where the
boys were standing.</p>

<p>“What seems to be the trouble, Peck,” he asked
as he drew near.</p>

<p>“Well, Ball,” Peck answered, “we seem to have
come upon two boy tramps. They’re harmless
enough, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going, boys?” Ball asked.</p>

<p>“Waiting for our chums to come back with the
boat,” answered Case.</p>

<p>“So you’ve got a boat have you?” Hart
exclaimed.</p>

<p>At the mention of a boat, Ball leaned forward
and eyed the boys critically, a suspicious gleam in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where is the boat now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Down the river,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You see,” Jule went on, helping Case to
answer the question, “one of the boys went out to
catch a fish and a coal tow chased him down. He’ll
be back directly. Ought to be here now.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a boat is it?” asked Ball.</p>

<p>“Motor boat,” replied Case.</p>

<p>Ball beckoned Peck and Hall a short distance
away and the three stood for some moments in
earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe there’s anything wrong with
the boys,” Peck was heard to say. “No use to
trouble them.”</p>

<p>“We can’t afford to take any chances,” Hart
replied. “Just where did you see that motor boat?”
he went on turning to Peck.</p>

<p>“Some distance up the river,” was the reply.
“I went out to a bar where several coal barges had
stranded to see if the pirates had had anything to
do with the trouble, and there I saw a motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Did you talk with the boys?” Peck asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Peck answered, “I talked with the boys,
and they talked straight enough, but I didn’t like
their suspicious actions. They couldn’t give any
account of themselves, except that they were going
down the river just for the fun of the thing.
Besides, I’m certain they heard the men talking and
the horses fussing on the bank. I saw them
looking that way several times. I’m rather afraid of
them!”</p>

<p>“Did they ask you a lot of questions?” demanded Hart.</p>

<p>“Why,” was the reply, “I told them we were out
after the river pirates, and they seemed satisfied
with that.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” Hart insisted, “that we ought
not to turn these boys loose. I just believe they’re
spies sent here by our enemies. It can’t do any
harm to take charge of them for a little while, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Still, this motor boat,” Peck suggested, “is a
mighty fine craft, and these boys appear to me to
belong to wealthy families. The boat will soon be
back here, if what the boys say is true, and then
inquiries will be made, and the first thing we know
the District Attorney will have every one of our
names before the grand jury.”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” Hart said reluctantly, “and
if I thought the boys would go on about their
business as soon as the boat returns, I’d be in favor of
letting them alone, but I don’t believe they will.
They’ll just sneak and pry around here until they
get us into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’d better put the whole matter up to
the others,” suggested Ball, “then, whatever action
is taken, we can’t be blamed.”</p>

<p>“Now see here, fellows,” Peck exclaimed,
“there are quite a number of reckless fellows in that
company over there, and I’m afraid they wouldn’t
take into consideration the fact that they are
dealing with little boys. Now I’ll tell you what
I propose.</p>

<p>“If you think best, I’ll take the boys up to
the house and leave them there with the old woman.
Then we’ll scatter, and by the time the boys get
back with their friends, the country will be as
peaceful as a stony farm in Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right,” Hart agreed, “provided
some of us remain here and take charge of the other
boys when they return.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that advisable,” Peck admitted.
“Now, I’ll tell you what you do, Ball, and perhaps
you’d better go with him, Hart—you take these boys
over to my place and leave them there with
instructions to the old lady to keep them safe and sound
until I get back. While you’re gone. I’ll dismiss
the company and stay on watch here.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea!” Ball declared. “We don’t
mean any harm to these boys, but we certainly must
keep track of them until they get out of the
country. If their friends come back here and seem
to be all right, we’ll pack them all off in their own
boat, and wish them good luck on their trip down
the river. We can’t be too careful, you know.”</p>

<p>The plan mapped out in this conversation was
carried out. Case and Jule were marched to the
farm house where Clay had taken his breakfast and
locked up in a room guarded by the motherly old
lady who had been so kind to Clay. Dismayed but
not disheartened at the sudden change of fortune,
the boys sat down on rude chairs in their not very
secure prison and regarded each other with humorous
glances.</p>

<p>“And when we wake up,” Jule mocked, “well
see the <i>Rambler</i> riding in the cove and Alex
cooking a catfish a la Indian at the fire! If I couldn’t
get things any straighter than you can, Case, I’d
certainly go out of the prophet business! As a
forecaster of future events, you’re about as big a
frost as the weather department of the United
States Government! What does all this mean,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“You can search me,” Case answered a little
sourly. “I don’ know whether we’re under arrest,
or whether we’ve been snatched up by a choice
collection of river pirates, or stored away for
ransom by whitecaps.”</p>

<p>“The leading impression in my mind, if you
want to know,” Jule announced, “isn’t in my mind
at all; it’s in my stomach!”</p>

<p>“You’re always hungry!” laughed Case.</p>

<p>“Hungry!” repeated Jule. “The word hunger
doesn’t express it. I wonder if the old lady will
give us something to eat.”</p>

<p>“And indeed I will!” cried a feminine voice
from the other side of the door. “Sure I will,
boys! Somehow it seems to be raining boys on
this ’tarnal old farm this morning!”</p>

<p>“Let us out,” Clay suggested, “and we’ll help
you get something to eat. You’ll want water or
wood to be brought, or something of that kind.
We won’t run away.”</p>

<p>“I reckon my old batter pail will be empty if
any more hungry lads come up from the river,”
Mrs. Peck went on, opening the door.</p>

<p>“Did you have one hungry boy here this
morning?” asked Case.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peck replied in the affirmative, and Case and
Jule exchanged significant glances. They
understood very well who that hungry boy was, and, in
answer to questions asked of the friendly old
woman, were soon in possession of all the facts
connected with Clay’s visit to the place and return to
the river.</p>

<p>And while the boys were eating a generous breakfast
prepared by their kind-hearted jailor, Alex,
Clay and Uncle Zeke were discussing the possibility
of reaching the <i>Rambler</i> by the cut-off across
Horseshoe bend.</p>

<p>While they talked and planned two pair of black,
suspicious eyes were gazing out at them from the
undergrowth on the east side of the cove, and the
dog was sniffing suspiciously in that direction.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII.—THE NIGHT-RIDERS.</h2>

<p class='first'>While the two boys laid their plans by the
embers of the camp-fire, Peck and his companion,
the watchers, moved stealthily over in their
direction and came within sound of their voices.</p>

<p>“Now, Uncle Zeke,” they heard Alex say, “if
you can get us through the cut-off and bring us out
to where the pirates have their ‘nest’, as you call
it, we’ll give you ten dollars, and if we succeed in
getting the <i>Rambler</i> away from them, we’ll take
you down the river with us and get you a good job
up north.”</p>

<p>“Ah’d hab to work up norf!” Uncle Zeke answered
with a grin.</p>

<p>“You certainly would,” Clay laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did cotton to no work!” the negro
replied.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” Alex promised, “if we get the
boat, we’ll give you twenty-five dollars. Now,
you’ll do your best to get us through, won’t you?
We’ve just got to get that craft and slide out of
this country.”</p>

<p>“That’s about what I thought!” Peck whispered
to his companion. “All the boys want is to get
their boat back and get out of the country.”</p>

<p>“What was it that kid said about pirates?” asked
the other.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the pirates stole their boat,” suggested
Peck.</p>

<p>“If we keep still, we’ll soon find out, probably.”</p>

<p>“Before we leave this country,” Clay said in a
moment, “we ought to get even with those pirates
in some way. They tried to shut us into the lagoon
so they could get possession of the boat, and we got
away from them. Now they’ve actually captured
the <i>Rambler</i>, and may do a lot of harm to the
motors before we can get it back. I don’t believe
they know how to run a boat like the <i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>“There!” Peck exclaimed, nudging his companion
in the side. “Them pesky pirates are to
blame for the boys being here. Now if these boys
have seen anything that might make us trouble,
these river robbers are to blame for it. I wish we
hadn’t sent the two kids we found here up to the
house. They are having troubles enough of their
own.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Peck’s companion observed, “I don’t
see any necessity for us to remain here after this.
We’ve got to see a lot of the boys to-day, after we
find out exactly what is to be done to-night, and so
we may as well go on about our business.”</p>

<p>Peck hesitated for a long time before he replied.</p>

<p>“The boys,” he said then, “seem to be bribing
the old nigger to show them the way through the
cut-off.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I get it.”</p>

<p>“And the old coon’s been telling them that the
pirates have a rendezvous somewhere near the end
of the cut-off. Is that the way you understand it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what the boy said,” was the answer.
“Anyway, they’re expecting the nigger to take
them to the pirates’ rendezvous and help them get
their boat back.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Peck continued, “if you’re satisfied that
it’s the right thing to do, I’ll go back to the house,
turn the other boys loose, and tell them where they
can find their friends.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right so far as I’m concerned.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe ran inquisitively toward the thicket
as the men moved away, but made no demonstration,
as the intruders were not approaching the fire.</p>

<p>“Now,” Alex said, “if we can persuade Uncle
Zeke to bring in a large, long piece of firewood,
or a stone from the river, or some edible thing of
that sort. I’ll have breakfast. If you can’t find
anything of that sort that I can digest, Uncle Zeke,”
he went on whimsically, “pass me one of the oars
and I’ll take a light lunch off that.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay laughed, “what’s the matter with
Uncle Zeke going out and getting a fish?”</p>

<p>“That may be all right,” Alex replied. “But
look here, Uncle Zeke,” he went on, “if you get
hold of a fish of the forty-mule-power variety, don’t
you ever try to pull him in! He’ll drag you down
the river, and there’s a party of thieves in a
houseboat down there who are waiting for some nice fat
darkey to cook for their dinner.”</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did cotton to no houseboat trash!”
the negro exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Can you catch a fish for this starving boy?”
demanded Clay.</p>

<p>“Ah suah can!” answered Uncle Zeke. “Dar’s
plenty ob fish in de ribber, but Ah hain’t got no hook
an’ line.”</p>

<p>“Can you find bait?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Worms and grubs!” replied the darker pointing
to the bank of the river.</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay informed him, “there are hooks
and lines under the prow of the rowboat. You’ll
find all kinds of fishing outfit there, including a
piece of a jointed bamboo rod. If I wasn’t so
nearly dead for want of sleep, I’d go and catch a
fish myself!”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket!” cried Alex. “You crawl
under there and go to sleep, and when Uncle Zeke
and I come back from our fishing trip, you’ll be
somewhere up in the blue sky looking for Case and
Jule.”</p>

<p>“Mighty funny thing where those boys went
to!” Clay suggested. “Do the pirates ever come
over into this cove, Uncle Zeke?” he added.</p>

<p>The negro, being somewhat puzzled at the abrupt
question, Clay explained to him that two of their
chums had disappeared in a mysterious manner.
After listening to the explanation, the old negro
made a circuit of the cove, examining the turf
closely as he passed along.</p>

<p>When he returned to the embers of the fire, what
was left of his gray hair was standing almost on end
notwithstanding its natural kinkiness. The terror
he had felt at the sight of the bear was nothing to
this.</p>

<p>“What is it, Uncle Zeke?” Alex asked.</p>

<p>“Night-riders!” replied the old darkey.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get a new dream book, Uncle
Zeke!” Alex laughed. “Ten or fifteen years ago
there were night-riders, and all that sort of thing
in Kentucky, but nothing of that kind goes now.”</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did cotton to no night-riders!”
exclaimed the negro.</p>

<p>“What makes you think night-riders have been
here?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“’Cause,” answered the negro, “dey’re gettin’
mighty promiscuous lately. Ah’m feared ob dem
night-riders.”</p>

<p>“What did you see over there?” demanded Clay,</p>

<p>“Hoss tracks!” answered the negro.</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other with understanding
in their eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the trampling we heard at
the bar where the barges were stranded?” asked
Alex.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Clay, “and I remember, too, the
horses tied in the thicket near the house where I
had breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the night-riders carried the boys
away?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Ah sure do!” replied Uncle Zeke. “Mighty
’spicious people, dem night-riders! Ah nebber did
cotton to ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex suggested in a moment, “you go
see if you can get a fish. I’ll stay here with Clay
and watch for night-riders. If they show up while
you’re gone. I’ll pick out the fattest one and eat him
for breakfast. I’m hungry enough to eat a night-rider,
horse and all!”</p>

<p>Uncle Zeke disappeared in the direction of the
boat with a grin on his black face, and in a few
moments Alex had the satisfaction of seeing him
haul a couple of good-sized perch from the river.
The boy instantly darted into the thicket after dry
wood, and before many minutes the old darkey was
on shore with his catch.</p>

<p>“Now,” Alex asked, “how am I ever going to
get them cooked?”</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay answered, “there’s a small frying-pan
in the bow locker of the boat. Don’t you
remember how we always kept a few provisions
and cooking utensils in there in case of accident?”</p>

<p>“What kind of provisions?” shouted Alex,
dancing about.</p>

<p>“Why, canned beans, and tomatoes, and
chicken!” answered Clay.</p>

<p>“Je—rusalem, my happy home!” shouted Alex.
“Do you mean to tell me that all that good eating
has been in the boat all this time while my stomach
has been growing to my back bone?”</p>

<p>He dashed off to the boat as he spoke, and soon
returned with a beaming face, his arms piled high
with tinned goods. He soon had some of the cans
opened and before many minutes, the perch were
sizzling in the frying-pan.</p>

<p>“Ah sure should know ’bout that chicken!”
grinned Uncle Zeke as he watched the boys open a
tin can.</p>

<p>Clay sat back and laughed heartily at the puzzled
expression on the negro’s face.</p>

<p>“If you’d only known about that chicken being
there, you’d have found a place for it long before
this, wouldn’t you. Uncle Zeke?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ah sure would!” replied the old darkey. “Ah
sure done gettin’ hungry right now! Yaller-legged
chicken! Huh!”</p>

<p>“All right!” Clay suggested. “As soon as Alex
gets the fish ready, we’ll all have breakfast. I’ve
had one good feed this morning, but I can stand
another.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” the old darkey continued with
his eyes fixed ravenously on the frying fish. “Ah
don’t go through no cut-off wid de sun up! Dat
country’s full of pesky pirates.”</p>

<p>“Mother of Moses!” cried Alex. “Have we got
to wait here until night? If we have, I’ll spend the
time eating.”</p>

<p>“That might not be a bad idea!” Clay exclaimed.
“Case and Jule may come back before long. If
they really have been captured by the night-riders,
they won’t be held very long.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know that,” Alex insisted. “The
man we talked with up at the barges was probably
a night-rider, and he talked fair enough, but if
they suspect the boys of being spies, it will be a
long time before they gain their liberty.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Clay suggested, “if we have to remain
here until twilight, we can look about on the
chance of finding the kids.”</p>

<p>“Ah’m advisin’ you boys not to do no lookin’
about in dis here country!” Uncle Zeke exclaimed.
“Mighty ’spicious people, dem night-riders!”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly the idea, Alex!” Clay expressed
himself. “The night-riders probably suspect that
we are here as spies and that’s why they have taken
the boys away. Now there’ll probably be something
doing here before long, for the riders seem to be
out in force.</p>

<p>“After they have accomplished the purpose of
their gathering, they’ll probably disband, and there’ll
be no more trouble with them until they get ready
to burn down another tobacco warehouse, or beat
up some defenseless grower, whose only crime is to
want to get rid of his product.”</p>

<p>While these events had been taking place at the
landing, Case and Jule, very much to their surprise,
had been released from surveillance at the farm
house and advised to make their way back to the
river.</p>

<p>“My old man declares there’s no harm in you-ins,”
Mrs. Peck said, as she patted the boys on the
shoulder in a motherly way and wished them good
luck. “You’ll probably find your friends at the
cove,” she said, “for our folks just returned from
there, and the boys were waiting for you to show
up. Only don’t say a word about having been
brought here at all. It will be better for you not
to.”</p>

<p>The boys agreed to this, and shot away at a
double-quick pace toward the cove, anxious to meet
their chums, and doubly anxious to be on the deck
of the good old <i>Rambler</i> again. They were hardly
outside the clearing in the middle of which the old
farm house stood when a party of a dozen men came
dashing across the weed-grown field and approached
the old woman now standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Where are those boys?” the man who seemed
to be the leader of the party demanded. “Bring
them out here, quick!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, several members of the party
flourished long beechen whips which had evidently
been cut from the forest very recently.</p>

<p>“What do you-uns want of the boys?” asked the
old lady mildly. “We’ll explain that to them!”
answered the leader, his face flushing with anger.
“We don’t have to be cross-examined by you.”</p>

<p>“I sho’ hope those boys hain’t done no mischief,”
the woman replied.</p>

<p>“They’re spies!” the leader shouted. “We’ve
just found out that they’re spies! The word came
down the river! Where are they?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure sorry,” Mrs. Peck answered, “but Ball
done brought me word from my old man to turn
the lads loose.”</p>

<p>“Which way did they go?” demanded the leader.
Mrs. Peck hesitated. She knew what her fate
would be should she attempt to deceive these lawless
night-riders, and should be detected. Her idea
was to protect the boys as far as lay in her power,
yet she did not want to render herself and family
liable to the wrath of the riders.</p>

<p>“Sho’, now,” she said after a moment’s silence,
“them boys ducked out of the clearing somewhere
west, and I was that stupid that I didn’t see whether
they kept straight on west or not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use of talking with a woman?”
demanded one of the riders. “The boys undoubtedly
returned to the river. We’ll find them
there if we make haste.”</p>

<p>“And when we do find them,” the leader declared
spitefully, “we’ll give them a bit of instruction
according to Doctor Birch. We have desperate
work on hand for the next week, and we can’t afford
to have our plans frustrated by a few school-boys!”</p>

<p>The party dashed away at a gallop. The old
lady saw them approach the forest with a sinking
heart.</p>

<p>Before they reached the tumbled-down fence,
however, she saw them wheel suddenly about and
point with their whips to the south, where a mass of
flame and smoke was roaring skyward.</p>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXIII'>CHAPTER XXIII.—THE RAMBLER’S LIGHTS.</h2>

<p class='first'>Unmindful of the peril which they had so
fortunately escaped, Case and Jule made their way
through the forest in quick time and finally came to
a point from which the camp at the head of the cove
was to be seen. It is needless to say that the sight
of their chums was more than pleasing.</p>

<p>At the moment of their approach, Alex was taking
the fish from the fire, Clay was opening tinned
goods, and Uncle Zeke stood mourning over the
fact that he had not sooner discovered the presence
of the yellow-legged chicken.</p>

<p>The boys dashed down to the fire with shouts of
joy, and the reader may well understand that their
welcome was a hearty one.</p>

<p>“Where’s the <i>Rambler</i>?” Case asked of Alex
after the greetings were over. “She ought to be
put there in the cove.”</p>

<p>“The pirates got her!” Alex answered briefly.</p>

<p>“Have you been to breakfast?” Clay cut in.</p>

<p>“Have we been to breakfast?” repeated Case,</p>

<p>“We’ve been captured, and fed, and released since
we saw you. Do you know, boys,” he added, dancing
cautiously around, “that I’ve got an idea that
we’re mixing up with night-riders.”</p>

<p>“We have just been informed of that fact by
Uncle Zeke,” Clay answered. “Where did you
see night-riders?” he added.</p>

<p>“Just after you left,” Case explained, “a company
of men came here on horses. We heard them
talking about our being spies. Then we were taken
to a house back in the country and locked up.
Then we were given a peach of a breakfast by the
kindliest old lady you ever saw and turned loose.
Now what do you think of all that?”</p>

<p>“Night-riders!” exclaimed Alex. “Why do the
riders ride, and why do the riders ride at night?”
“You’ve come to the right shop for information,”
Jule replied with a grin. “Just before we left
Chicago I was reading a book about night-riders.
They ride because they can’t get over the ground
fast enough on foot, and they ride at night because
they don’t want any one to see them riding.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” chuckled Alex. “Now tell
me what they ride for. In other words, what’s the
answer?”</p>

<p>“The night-riders want ten or twelve cents a
pound for their tobacco, and the planters on the
lower lands near the river are willing to sell theirs
for five or six cents a pound, because they can raise
more crops a year and because their land is easier
tilled.”</p>

<p>“And so they’re getting up a combination in
restraint of trade, eh?” laughed Alex. “That
seems to be the proper thing to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Jule went on, “but
they’re trying to equalize prices by reducing the
supply. Whenever these river planters get nice big
warehouses packed full of the weed, the night-riders
make their appearance in the dark of the moon and
burn them down.”</p>

<p>“This night-rider business was all right ten or
fifteen years ago,” Clay insisted, “but I don’t
believe there’s anything doing in that line now.”</p>

<p>“Then what are all these men out with their
horses for?” demanded Jule.</p>

<p>“Yes, and why did they lug us off to a farm
house, and lock us up until some one sent word that
we wasn’t spies?” Case demanded.</p>

<p>The boys now turned their attention to the old
negro who stood on a little elevation at the back of
the cove sniffing suspiciously at the air.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that coon?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“He brought our boat down the river to us,”
laughed Alex.</p>

<p>“Honest, did he?” demanded Jule.</p>

<p>“If he hadn’t, we wouldn’t be eating tinned goods
would we?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Why, you might get those out of the <i>Rambler</i>,”
Case ventured. “That was a joke about the pirates
getting the motor boat, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it wasn’t!” Alex replied gravely, and
in a short time the story of the boys’ morning
adventures was told.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s what I call rotten!” Jule cried out.
“And I move that we get to a telegraph office
somewhere and notify some central point from
which all the police boats on the river can be notified
of what has been done. We’ve got to get the boat
back!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to call out the state troops,” Clay
grinned. “We got into this scrape, and I want to
get out of it without any help from the officers if
possible. Uncle Zeke thinks he can take us to the
<i>Rambler</i> to-night, and we’re going to wait here
until the edge of the evening and make the attempt.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Uncle Zeke?” asked
Case. “He stands up there snuffing the air as if he
smelled more chicken.”</p>

<p>In a moment the old negro came dashing down
to where the boys stood, his eyes almost starting
from his head.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t take much to frighten you, Uncle
Zeke,” Clay laughed as the old darkey came up on
a run. “According to all accounts, you have fits
on the slightest provocation. The bear and the dog
and the tracks of horses’ feet have all set you going
this morning. What is it this time?”</p>

<p>“It’s done broke out! It’s done broke out!” exclaimed
the negro looking wildly about and even
starting for the rowboat.</p>

<p>Clay caught him by the arm and held him back.
“Here,” he said, “you ain’t going away with
that boat right now! See if you can’t catch your
breath long enough to tell us what’s ‘done broke
out’. Put us wise to what the trouble is.”</p>

<p>“De night-riders done broke out!” cried the old
negro. “Ah smell ’em!”</p>

<p>“What is it you smell?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Burnin’ ’baccy!” was the reply. “Dey done
fire some warehouse!”</p>

<p>“Not in the daytime!” exclaimed Jule. “They
don’t set fire to warehouses in the daytime!”</p>

<p>“Cain’t nebber tell whut dem night-riders gwine
do nex’,” answered Uncle Zeke. “Dey’re pow’ful
ornery trash!”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do next!” Alex
exclaimed. “I’ve got a misery in my stomach and
I’m going to quell it right now!”</p>

<p>“You hungry, Uncle Zeke?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Ah sure got mah eye on dat chicken!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay went on, “if you run up through
that fringe of trees and see what’s burning, I’ll
give you some chicken as soon as you get back.”</p>

<p>The old negro was off like a shot. In ten minutes
he was back with the report that he had learned
from a farmer who was hastening toward the
conflagration that the Slocum warehouses, not more
than half a mile away, had been set on fire just
before daylight and had smoldered for hours before
bursting into flames.</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” Case suggested, “that the best
thing we boys can do is to get out of this country
right now. We’ve bumped into river pirates, and
night-riders, and the next we know, we’ll be arrested
by some fresh officers charged with being in cahoots
with the incendiaries.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to run away without that motor
boat,” Alex muttered, his mouth full of fried fish.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” asked Jule. “If we start
out now, we’re likely to be followed, and if we
remain here in camp we may escape observation.
The night-riders know we’re here, of course, but
they’ll be too busy getting under cover to pay any
attention to us to-day.”</p>

<p>“That listens good to me!” Alex put in.
“We’ll stay here till night and work our way
through the cut-off by the light of burning warehouses.
I wish I could say ‘by the light of burning saloon
boats’, too.”</p>

<p>“Talk about your wild life at the head waters of
the Amazon!” roared Clay, “this peaceful little old
Ohio river beats anything we have encountered yet.
We seem to get into the thick of it everywhere we
go.”</p>

<p>The boys were not molested during the day.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon a negro who looked about as
badly frightened as one could imagine, came down
the river in an old canoe and stopped to talk with
Zeke.</p>

<p>He stated that the night-riders had destroyed
several warehouses the night before, and had also
whipped several planters who had resisted.</p>

<p>“Ah nebber did done cotton to no night-riders!”
the old darkey informed the boys as he repeated the
story.</p>

<p>“I wonder if those outlaws will make trouble for
Mrs. Peck for letting us go,” mused Case. “Say,
Uncle Zeke!” he said in a moment. “If you’ll send
this friend of yours up to a farm house in the
interior, we’ll give you a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Ah wants dat dollah!” Zeke exclaimed.</p>

<p>“All right, go yourself if you want to,” Case
answered. “We want to know if the woman in
the farm house has been troubled at all by the
night-riders. We want you to go and tell her that we’re
down here in the cove, and will do all we can to
help her if she gets into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s mah dollah!” cried Uncle Zeke already on
his way.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours the negro returned with
the information that he had talked with the woman,
and that she had seemed grateful for the offer made.
He stated, too, that there were men about the house,
and that they had been highly amused at the message
he had delivered.</p>

<p>“Dey sure done laugh at dis ol’ coon!” Uncle
Zeke added, “when ah tole ’em you-all wanted to
come up an’ fight for de lady what gib you-all
pancakes an’ coffee. Dey sure did roar!”</p>

<p>“What did they say about the burning
warehouse?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Ah sure don’ mention no burnin’ warehouse
where dem men is,” replied the darkey. “Mought
be dey set dat fire demselves.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case said handing the darkey a silver
dollar. “Here’s your money. I would have given
more to have informed the old lady that we felt
grateful for what she did for us this morning.”</p>

<p>“She shore glad you-all feel so!” Uncle Zeke
replied.</p>

<p>At five o’clock in the afternoon, Alex sent Uncle
Zeke out to catch more fish and began building up
the fire.</p>

<p>“What’s coming off now?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“What do you ’spose is coming off?” demanded
Alex. “I haven’t had anything to eat for two or
three hours.”</p>

<p>“The kid is all right!” Clay declared. “We
must get supper early and make up a lot of sandwiches
for midnight. We may have to lay and
wait in the cut-off for hours before we can get to
the <i>Rambler</i>. We can’t show any lights, and so it
will be impossible to cook. So, as Alex will be
sure to be hungry, we’ll take our midnight supper
with us.”</p>

<p>“What you going to make your sandwiches of?”
asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Huh,” laughed Alex, “I’m going to take fat
perch and stuff ’em with beans and chicken. How
would a sandwich like that go on South Clark
street?”</p>

<p>“It would go down mighty quick!” laughed Jule.</p>

<p>After eating their supper and putting up a large
supply of provisions for the night, the boys made
ready for their trip to what Zeke declared to be the
pirates’ nest. They were at twilight, moving slowly,
silently across the river and then down the cut-off,
which at high water was navigable for small boats,
and which would soon make an island of the
peninsula enclosed within the rim of the river.</p>

<p>By nine o’clock it was very dark. The trees overhanging
the narrow channel through which the boat
was poled and dragged—the water being too
shallow in places for the use of the oars—stood like
grim walls, shutting out what little light came from
the uncertain sky.</p>

<p>Owing to fallen trunks and heaps of rubbish
washed in by a recent freshet, the cut-off was
difficult of navigation, but just after midnight the lads
saw across a wooded point of land a strong light
flash out for a moment and then die away.</p>

<p>“And there burn the <i>Rambler</i>’s light” Alex
cried.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXIV'>CHAPTER XXIV.—THE LIGHTS HELP SOME.</h2>

<p class='first'>I’d give a good deal to know just how many
people there are around that boat!” Clay whispered.</p>

<p>“If you’ll just push this old scow up a little
closer, I’ll sneak over there and find out,” said Alex.</p>

<p>“If he tries to get away, tie him up with a rope!”
whispered Jule. “Every time that boy gets out of
sight, he lands in trouble up to his long ears!”</p>

<p>“There were only two when I left the <i>Rambler</i>,”
Alex exclaimed, making a sly face at Jule. “They
shot a dozen bullets at me while I was getting away,
and never turned a hair!”</p>

<p>The boat was worked slowly through another
hundred yards of the cut-off, and then the boys
could see the bulk of the <i>Rambler</i> outlined against
a cloudy sky. There were no lights on board and
no sounds were heard.</p>

<p>The boat lay in a sort of a bight carved out by
the river as it bent away to the north just before it
made the western turn. Behind it was a tangle of
swamp.</p>

<p>In front swept the heavy current of the river.
The rowboat halted within perhaps a hundred yards
of the place where the stolen <i>Rambler</i> lay.</p>

<p>“If they had had the good sense to anchor on
the other side of the river,” Case whispered to Alex,
“they might have made us a lot more trouble. I’m
glad they stopped where they did.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there are a whole lot of outlaws on
board,” Clay whispered, as the boys sat in the
rowboat, watching the dim bulk of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Then the two thieves who stole the boat have
picked them up out of the river,” Alex insisted.
“There were only two when I left the deck, and
they came off from a coal tow which was going
downstream.”</p>

<p>“If there were only two, we ought to go and
blow the tops of their heads off, and take the boat
away from them, just to show that we can,” said
Jule. “We ought to do something to show them
that they’re not the only apples on the tree. Don’t
you think so, boys?”</p>

<p>“You’re the bloodthirsty little pirate now!”
laughed Clay. “I’ll be satisfied if we can dump
them in the river and get on board the good old
<i>Rambler</i> again.”</p>

<p>The boys sat still in the boat for a long time,
hardly knowing what course to pursue. The sky
was clearing of clouds, and the glow of the stars
shone dimly down on the <i>Rambler</i>. Although no
lights showed on board the motor boat, suspicious
noises in the cabin and on the deck informed the
lads that people were moving about there.</p>

<p>“They’re awake and watching us, all right!”
Alex whispered, after a time. “We’ve got to do
something to place them off their guard!”</p>

<p>While the boys were listening and waiting,
Captain Joe sprang out of the boat and waded and swam
over to the hard ground on the south of the cut-off.
The boys saw only a white flash as the bulldog left
the water and disappeared in the darkness of the
jungle. Teddy, the bear, seemed inclined to follow
him, but the boys held him back by main force.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder,” whispered Jule, “if the pirates
are over there, too! If they’ve got us surrounded,
we’re likely to open a barrel of trouble in about a
minute.”</p>

<p>The noise made by Captain Joe and also by the
struggle with the bear apparently attracted the
attention of those on board the <i>Rambler</i>, for a
faint light blazed up in the cabin of the motor boat
for an instant and was then extinguished.</p>

<p>“They’re getting their guns ready, I guess,” Clay
whispered. “Suppose we pull the boat under the
shadow of the bank and take to the shore. We
might be safer there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I think,” Case observed.
“When those fellows turned on the light they were
getting ready to set the motors going. If we don’t
watch out, they’ll have the <i>Rambler</i> whizzing
downstream at the rate of twenty miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Jule declared, “if we go ashore we may
get into trouble there, so I propose that we land on
the north side of the cut-off and try to make a sneak
on board.”</p>

<p>“Whatever we do,” Clay advised, “we ought to
keep the boat within reach so that, if they do go
on downstream, we can follow them as fast as the
current will carry us.”</p>

<p>The boys argued in whispers for some time over
Clay’s proposition and then Alex broke out:</p>

<p>“If you fellows will push over to the south shore
for a minute, I’ll get out and see what is going on
there. I don’t like the idea of having a gang of
pirates come up behind us after we land and advance
to the <i>Rambler</i>. That wouldn’t look well.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you never let him go!” Case advised.
“If you do, he’ll get mired in a swamp or bring
a company of night-riders on top of us.”</p>

<p>Alex, however, did not wait for the boys to
either pole the boat to the south shore, or to decide
as to whether he ought to land. Before any further
objections could be offered, he was up to his waist
in water moving toward the shadows on the south
bank.</p>

<p>“The little monkey!” whispered Case. “I wish
I had a rope around his neck!”</p>

<p>“What shall we do now?” asked Jule. “We
can’t go away and leave him in that patch of
woods.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better go on over to the north
shore and see if we can retake the <i>Rambler</i>” Clay
answered. “Alex, probably, has some notion in his
head which we don’t understand, and, anyway, he is
capable of taking care of himself.”</p>

<p>In accordance with this idea, the three boys
landed and, leaving Uncle Zeke in charge of the
boat and the bear, with instructions to answer
Alex’s call from the south bank, they took their way
to the bight in which the <i>Rambler</i> lay. They had
only a shore distance to go, and were soon within a
few feet of the motor boat, which lay within a
couple of yards of the shore.</p>

<p>From the position they now occupied, they could
see a dilapidated old houseboat lying beyond the
<i>Rambler</i>, her nose resting lightly on the bank.</p>

<p>“That’s where the pirates have been living!”
whispered Case. “If we could only do something
to drive them back to the old hulk, we might
possibly get the <i>Rambler</i> away.”</p>

<p>All remained dark and silent on board the motor
boat, still the boys knew that the men on board were
awake and alert. They had seen the prow light
turned on when farther up the cut-off, and only a
few moments before a light had shone in the cabin.</p>

<p>The boys waited for what seemed to them an
hour or more, watching and listening, hoping for
Alex’s return, and hoping, too, for some indication
of the intentions of the pirates.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to make a break pretty soon,”
Jule said. “I believe those fellows on board the
boat know that we’re in the vicinity. They’re not
asleep, and they wouldn’t be sitting there in the
dark unless they were suspicious.”</p>

<p>“If you boys will stay here,” Clay suggested,
“I’ll attempt to gain the after deck of the <i>Rambler</i>.
If I succeed, I may be able to drive the pirates out
of the boat.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of that myself!” whispered
Case.</p>

<p>“You remain here,” Clay went on, “and I’ll see
what can be done.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before
the “chug, chug, chug,” of motors was heard, and
the <i>Rambler</i>, still showing no lights, glided softly
upstream!</p>

<p>After proceeding a few paces, however, the power
was shut off, and she remained swinging in the
almost stagnant waters of the bight. Her position
was, perhaps, a hundred paces to the north of the
cut-off, and perhaps ten paces from the shore where
the boys were.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve got us going now!” Case exclaimed
regretfully. “They’ll shoot upstream in a
minute, and that’ll be the last of the merry
old <i>Rambler</i>! We’ll have to build another boat, boys!”</p>

<p>No one replied, for just at that moment the splash
of oars and poles was heard, coming swiftly down
the cut-off. The boys turned their eyes in that
direction and almost shouted in their amazement as
three blue lights, following the channel of the cut-off,
proceeded to the west, to all appearances floating
six or eight feet above the surface of the water!
The boys stood silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think of that?” whispered
Clay. “Three times and out!”</p>

<p>“I know now what the three blue lights mean!”
gasped Case. “They constitute a signal used by the
night-riders!”</p>

<p>“There ain’t any tobacco warehouses to burn
here!” Jule scoffed.</p>

<p>The three blue lights came on steadily, stopping
after a time at the very mouth of the cut-off, two
or three hundred feet from where the <i>Rambler</i> lay.</p>

<p>Heretofore the lights had seemed to be floating in
the air. Now the boys could faintly distinguish the
bulk of a boat looking weird and ghostly under the
mysterious illumination.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that won’t scare the pirates?” asked
Jule.</p>

<p>The answer came from the <i>Rambler</i> itself, for
the motors were turned on and the boat whirled
swiftly away toward the opposite bank of the river.
Then a volley of shots rang out from the mysterious
boat, and a voice called over the water:</p>

<p>“Obey the signal, boys! If you don’t, we’ll fill
you full of lead! You know what three blue lights
mean!”</p>

<p>Much to the amazement of the boys, the motors
ceased their clatter and the <i>Rambler</i> lay swaying
just at the edge of the current.</p>

<p>“Do you mind that now?” whispered Case.
“The pirates on board the <i>Rambler</i> don’t know
that the outer walls are all bullet-proof!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXV'>CHAPTER XXV.—GRATEFUL NIGHT-RIDERS.</h2>

<p class='first'>The next moment the great flashlight on the
prow of the <i>Rambler</i> blazed out over the waters.</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Clay, “that’s our boat, and
there’s some one holding three blue lights up on a
stick!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed Jule, fairly dancing up and
down in his excitement, “and that little monkey in
the prow is Alex! He’s the one that’s holding up
the three blue lights! Now where do you suppose
he got that layout?”</p>

<p>“He has a way of picking things out of the
atmosphere!” laughed Case.</p>

<p>“Looks like a scene in a play!” cried Jule.</p>

<p>“That would be a mighty good place to drop a
curtain!” suggested Case.</p>

<p>“Not quite yet,” Clay insisted. “The scene
mustn’t close just yet. The audience wants to know
what the three blue lights are going to do to the
<i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>The boys were not long kept in waiting in this
regard. The rowboat, sunk almost to the guards
under the weight of four men and a boy, swept up
to the <i>Rambler</i>. Directly all were on the deck of
the motor boat. Alex dancing excitedly up and
down when he was not waltzing over the deck with
the white bulldog.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you let us in on that?” demanded
Jule from the bank.</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are!” shouted Alex springing
up on the gunwale. “We thought you boys had
gone and got lost. Wait a minute, and I’ll row the
boat over to you.”</p>

<p>The lad dropped into the rowboat with a tunk,
and soon had his wondering companions on the deck
of the motor boat. What they saw there added, if
possible, to the surprise of the previous five minutes.</p>

<p>Four men, two of whom Alex recognized as the
men who had stolen the boat, lay tied hard and fast
on the deck, and four other men, two of whom
had visited the camp at the cove during the forenoon,
were standing over them with guns in their
hands. The prisoners seemed to be trying to the
best of their ability to conciliate their stern-faced
guards.</p>

<p>“We didn’t know that you had an interest in the
outfit,” one of the prisoners was saying. “Those
boys rammed our steamer, and we were bound to
get even with them.”</p>

<p>“It’s hands off the boys!” exclaimed Peck
sternly. “What do you think we ought to do with
them?” he asked turning to his companions.</p>

<p>“We ought to stretch their necks!” was the fierce
reply.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind assisting at a necktie party,”
Peck answered, “but, under the circumstances, I
think we’d better not become too prominent in any
such society event. You three men pitch them over
into the old houseboat and drift along the river until
you come to a Government steamer. Then turn
them over as outlaws and return on the Government
steamer if it’s going upstream to the cove. If it’s
going downstream, get the first upboat you can.”</p>

<p>Peck’s authority seemed to be supreme, for in
five minutes the four bound men were transferred
to the houseboat which was then nosed out into the
stream by the <i>Rambler</i>. This done, Peck sat down
in a deck chair and regarded the four boys
quizzically.</p>

<p>“Where’s the old negro?” he asked in a moment.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear him splash in the water?”
asked Alex. “When you showed the three blue
lights, he waddled ashore with a face so white it
made a chalk-mark on the night.”</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed to the blue lights still
burning on the prow of the rowboat.</p>

<p>“It’s all easily explained,” Peck replied with an
engaging smile. “Just after two of you boys left
my house to-day, a gang of good fellows laboring
under a misapprehension came up with a supply of
birch whips intended for the backs of you kids.
Their attention was attracted to a burning building,
or they would have overtaken the lads before they
reached the cove and beaten them half to death.</p>

<p>“When I reached home, my wife told me of the
incident, and I began worrying for fear the boys
would be caught and mistreated. While we were
talking it over, that old nigger came up and said
that you boys wanted to do something for my wife
because she had been so good to you.</p>

<p>“This kindness on your part—this willingness to
do anything you could if we needed your help—stirred
me up considerable. So we started out
through the woods for the cove. When we got to
the cove, which was after dark, of course, you were
not there, and we’ve been floundering around in the
water and woods and bushes ever since. We crossed
the stream in a rickety old scow and landed on the
peninsula, thinking that perhaps the river pirates,
known to have headquarters here, had made trouble
for you.</p>

<p>“Just as we were about to turn back, this little
chap,” pointing at Captain Joe, “came plunging
through the bushes and we knew that you were not
far away. Then this boy came panting along and
we grabbed him. He was frightened half to death
for a minute, but when things were explained, he
told us the kind of a mixup you were in.</p>

<p>“Well, we came down to the cut-off and got into
the boat and came down here. Then we remembered
that the river pirates stand in deadly terror
of the three blue lights—our boys having been a
little rough with them!—so we put up the signal you
saw, and I guess that’s about all!”</p>

<p>“I guess I know what the three blue lights mean,”
Alex blurted out. “They constitute a signal used
by the night-riders. I don’t wonder the pirates are
afraid of them!”</p>

<p>“And I guess the night-riders are the ones who
keep the ghost stories about the lights going!” Jule
added.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Peck replied with a whimsical smile,
“I don’t know anything about that. One of my
friends, here, just happened to have three blue lights
with him, so we put ’em up to scare the pirates.
We thought that if we could make the outlaws believe
that we belonged to the night-riders, we could
throw a bigger scare into them.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Case laughed, winking at Peck,
“we never thought for a moment that you
gentlemen belonged to the night-riders!”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed Peck, winking back.
“Nobody around here belongs to the night-riders!
You might travel up and down the river, and over
the mountains, for a thousand miles, and not find
a night-rider in the whole country! Fact!” he
added, significantly.</p>

<p>“Do they put out blue lights whenever they’re
going to burn some one’s warehouse?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Boy,” answered Peck, patting Alex kindly on
the shoulder, “you mustn’t ask any questions about
the night-riders in this section of the country. They
think they are protecting their own interests in what
they do, and that’s all I know about it.”</p>

<p>“I’d just like to know how they make the lights
go out so quickly,” Jule grinned. “They go out
with a loud noise, don’t they.”</p>

<p>“I had that explained to me once,” replied Peck
with a queer smile, “and if you won’t say anything
about it. I’ll tell you how it’s done.”</p>

<p>“The three blue lights are placed on a board,
either floating on the water or suspended from
some elevation. On the same board is a stick of
dynamite with a long fuse. After the lights burn a
few moments—they are just little kerosene lamps
with blue globes, you know—the dynamite explodes
and that ends the display. Perfectly simple, ain’t
it, boys?”</p>

<p>“I should think it was!” answered Clay.</p>

<p>Peck remained on board the <i>Rambler</i> until
daylight, and then the boys took him back up the river
to the little cove near his own home. When at last
he shook hands with the lads at parting, they did
their best to reward him, but he refused every
offering made.</p>

<p>“I did this for you boys,” he said, “just because
you sent that word up to my wife. You thought
she was alone, and might be in trouble, on account
of the rough characters you had seen about, and you
notified her that you were ready and willing to fight
for her if she wanted any assistance. That was
enough for me!”</p>

<p>After cooking breakfast at the old camp at the
head of the cove, the boys again set out on their
journey. During the rest of the trip they avoided
saloon boats and coal tows.</p>

<p>They also tied up at night near some city or
town. Now and then they read in the daily
newspapers stories of alleged outrages by night-riders,
but their experiences with the men of the three blue
lights led them to make many excuses for them.</p>

<p>They spent nearly a month loitering along the
river, stopping here and there, sometimes tying up
for two or three days at a time. When at last they
saw the lights of Cairo they were heartily sorry
that the journey was ended.</p>

<p>“We have had a pleasant trip, mixed with a little
healthy excitement!” laughed Case, as they threw
out their lines at one of the lower wharves.</p>

<p>“A little excitement?” repeated Alex. “Say,
look here, kid, the Ohio is the sixth river we’ve
navigated, and she’s given us the liveliest run for
our money we’ve had yet.”</p>

<p>“And now,” Case said rather soberly, “we’ll sail
up the Mississippi, through the Illinois river and the
canal, and get back to our little pier up on the South
Branch.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Alex, “won’t Captain Joe,
the old sea-captain, be glad to see us come sailing
in?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’ll accept half our three-blue-lights’
stories as true!” Jule put in.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Clay replied, “we’ve had the experiences,
and Captain Joe can think what he likes!”</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
